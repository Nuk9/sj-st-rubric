He didnt check his cellphone during the hourlong visit and wasnt tailed by an entourage of district officials. His instructions to Principal Aida Fraser-Hammer were simple: Show me what youre proud of.In four short months, Nyland, 66, in his unassuming way, appears to have earned support from across the spectrum of Seattle Public Schools often-fractious landscape.The Seattle teachers union fully supports the idea of appointing him the districts permanent superintendent. The head of the business-backed Alliance for Education also has praised Nyland.He knows the business, said Jonathan Knapp, president of the Seattle Education Association. He understands the landscape in Washington state politically. Hes diligent. Hes an intellectual leader.Nyland has had a few missteps in the past few months but appears to have survived them by apologizing and taking responsibility.It also looks like he has a majority of votes from the Seattle School Board, which will vote Wednesday on whether to extend his contract for two more years, making him the permanent replacement for José Banda, who left for the Sacramento Unified School District in July.As I look at this Im thinking, What are the things that are stopping us from being great? board member Harium Martin-Morris said last week when the contract proposal was first publicly discussed.   And I think (Nyland) has a clear idea and vision of what those things are. Even board members critical of the appointment dont question Nylands ability to handle the challenge; they only say the board is moving too quickly. Two of them have proposed a one-year extension to his contract rather than two years.Big challengesIn some ways, Nyland has stepped into a district with problems   as big as the ones he confronted in Marysville when he was hired there in 2004.In Marysville, he  inherited a school district reeling from the longest teachers strike in Washington state history  49 days. Enrollment had dropped 5 percent.   Like Seattle, the district had experienced years of turnover at the top. Its School Board was divided on important issues, and tension was high between school and union leaders. The lines of communication between the school district and the union  and the district and the community  were broken, said Arden Watson, who was president of the Marysville teachers union during most of Nylands time as superintendent there.One of Nylands jobs was to rebuild that trust, she said, a task made easier because both Watson and Nyland came into their jobs at about the same time. From the beginning, I think his desire was to find ways to bring people together, to collaborate, Watson said. There wasnt anything that I felt like we couldnt have a discussion about, to try to work on, or try to come to some sort of consensus.But that doesnt mean all the discussions were easy.When the state cut school funding midyear, for example, Nyland asked teachers to take a small pay cut to help make ends meet. Watsons group said no, and Nyland made cuts elsewhere.Under Nyland, Marysville also opened a new high-school campus that housed several small schools with about 400 students each  a move that split the community,   with some questioning whether it was worth the cost to duplicate services over eight distinct schools. Others lamented the loss of specialty classes like music or foreign language that became harder to offer at the smaller schools.Some believed that was an instance in which Nyland didnt listen, including Randy Davis, now head of the Marysville teachers union, who opposed the change because he thought the small, specialized schools would lead students to self-segregate by their interests.We were never able to have that discussion, Davis said. It was just, You can have your questions, but were doing it.But from the School Boards perspective, Nyland rebuilt trust by being open and honest, said Chris Nation, the boards vice president. And it takes time. It takes years.Under Nylands watch, Marysvilles enrollment rebounded, although it started to drop again before he left. And two years after he arrived, the districts voters finally approved an $118 million school-construction bond issue, although it passed by just a handful of votes. In the proposal to offer Nyland the full superintendent post, Seattle school leaders also credit him with increasing graduation rates in Marysville by 22 percent, but state data suggest the districts graduation rates lurched up and down.  Solid experience Nyland grew up in Seattle, graduating from Roosevelt High in 1966. He earned a geography degree from the University of Washington and taught high school in Gig Harbor. He then moved to Alaska, where he worked as a principal and superintendent. His first superintendency in Washington was in Pasco, from 1982 to 1992.After that, he helped lead a superintendent-preparation program for Seattle Pacific University, served as interim superintendent in the Shoreline School District, then held a couple of administrative posts in the Highline district before moving to Marysville.Since he arrived in Seattle in August,    he has worked to ensure the district gets out of hot water over its special-education programs, and recently launched a 100-day plan to improve communication with parents.He also has had a few missteps, including signing a contract in September with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for $750,000 to help fund a preschool program at Bailey Gatzert Elementary months before the School Board voted on it. He later apologized.Sharon Peaslee, the outgoing Seattle School Board president, has said Nyland was simply following the procedures he was used to in Marysville. Nation, the Marysville School Board vice president, agreed.In November, a law firm working for the district released some 8,000 student records as part of a lawsuit over special-education services. The district fired the law firm and Nyland again apologized for what he called an inadvertent breach.Despite those problems,  much of the board appears to be behind Nyland. If the board approves a two-year contract on Wednesday, Nyland said that would be a step toward the stability that has eluded Seattle recently.Regardless of how long he stays, Nyland said, he intends to be more than a caretaker. His short list of goals: Revamping the districts special-education programs, modernizing its technology and supporting the human-resources staff, which he said isnt hiring teachers in a timely way.Gradually you fix one thing, then you fix another, and over time you build the momentum, you build the trust, you build the track record, Nyland said.

In one of the most fiscally conservative states in the country, a place where politicians cry socialism! at the mere mention of government in family life, lawmakers have for 16 years supported an expensive social program aimed at ensuring that every 4-year-old learns the alphabet. Oklahomas embrace of state-funded preschool  taught by teachers trained in early education, and open to all  has long attracted national attention. Georgetown University researchers make regular visits. The celebrated radio show, This American Life, produced a segment on it. Even the New York City Council came calling.Seattle took a look, too, because in a national landscape mushrooming with preschool programs from Boston to San Francisco, the Sooner State has been doing pre-K with success longer than anyplace else.Thirteen years of data on 3,000 Tulsa children show that a year of preschool creates profound differences in their ability to hit the ground running by kindergarten, with a nine-month jump-start in literacy skills and four months boost in math.That may have been a pleasant surprise for Republican legislators who, believing they were closing a loophole, voted for a bill that had preschool funding tucked unobtrusively into a little-examined paragraph. Little did they anticipate the effect.Parents flooded the program. It was high-quality and free. Kindergarten teachers, meanwhile, began to report dramatic differences between kids who came to them from pre-K programs and those without the year of classroom warm-up.But the holy grail of early education  lifetime outcomes  is what matters most. And by that metric, despite a decade and a half of universal free preschool, Oklahomas ranking is hardly stellar. Fourth- and eighth-graders perform below national averages in reading and math. Special education rates are rising. Even in third grade, children struggle.Why arent they passing the third-grade reading tests? Thats the gorilla in the room, said Lisa Williams, who teaches 4-year-olds at Kendall-Whittier Elementary in Tulsa, and is well aware that legislators have begun to question the value of state-funded pre-K.As she teaches one child to open a box of crayons, or another to work with Play-Doh, the grumbling in Oklahomas statehouse nags.We know, we know, Williams sighed, parroting the complaints: You guys have been doing this for 16 years, where is your success?The question underscores broad-based yearning for easy answers for Americas underperforming schools, and the daunting forces at play outside the classroom door.Oklahoma earmarks $143 million a year for early education. But that hardly counteracts surging poverty, an increase in students who need to learn English, or the states comparatively meager spending on schools overall, which languishes at 48th in the nation.We were really lucky that this program got passed when it did  before the recession and under a different governor, said Andy McKenzie, director of Early Childhood Services for the Tulsa School District. Because, honestly, I dont think wed be able to get it through today.Yet parents, heartened by the effects of pre-K  not to mention the pressure off their wallets  wouldnt hear of doing away with it.In Tulsa, most kids get their first taste of school through a pre-K classroom like Williams, which costs the school district $5,000 per child. About 75 percent of the citys 4-year-olds sign up.The poorest, however, are eligible for one of the best-regarded Head Start programs in the nation, part of a network of community agencies providing pre-K in ways similar to the two initiatives proposed for Seattle.Both pathways are funded by the state, but they offer distinctly different approaches and different outcomes, too.Each morning outside Williams classroom, 40 children, all in uniform, line up against a bank of steel lockers where they will struggle to stash their backpacks before sitting down for exercises in letter recognition. Kendall-Whittier Elementary has more than 950 children and houses its youngest in their own wing. I wish we didnt have to do everything this way, walking in a line to go everywhere. But we dont have a choice, said Grayce McCoy, who teaches those students when they move on to kindergarten. We have to walk in a line because there are 1,000 of us.Trying to boost childrens literacy and math skills, pre-K teachers begin their day by leading the group through an alphabet song, linking each letter with its sign-language symbol to make the abstract concepts concrete. Afterward, children are released one by one to assigned tables where, with the help of two aides, they page through picture books.In stark contrast, across town at the McClure Early Childhood Development Center, which is a Head Start site,   20 youngsters have arrayed themselves around a classroom rug as teacher Lauren Falzone reads the mornings story, David Goes to School. One boy continually spins round on his knees. Falzone  observed by an instructional coach  keeps talking, asking the children what they understand about each picture in the book. Whats his face look like? she says, pointing to a picture of David.Sad, says a girl named Arianna.Why do you think hes sad?Because he wants to go outside! Arianna squeals.The students names are everywhere  on the walls, their cubbies, the story-circle rug and a stand of toothbrushes lined up for use after snack. Later, each child chooses an activity for imaginative play. One girl worked in a make-believe kitchen near an easel posted with the Question of the Day: Have you ever been scared?Focused largely on helping kids with social interaction and emotions, McClures pre-K program is one of 13 run by Community Action Project (CAP) of Tulsa. Each costs about $15,000 per child, uses a Head Start model (with federal Head Start dollars on top of the state funding) and is open only to children living below the poverty line.Jeremiah and Takisha Quitto have put three children through McClure, though initially neither felt good about what they called institutional day care. Now, with their eldest daughter testing for Tulsas gifted-learner program, they rave.  When I walked in and felt the excitement here  the passion, the welcoming  my first thought was, am I in the right place? Because Id never seen anything like that in a school, said Takisha, a laid-off nurse studying for her masters degree in human services.Once I saw all the social and emotional education they do, I thought theyre better off here than home with me. They get more opportunities to interact with peers and use their words.But blending children from Head Start with those who come to kindergarten via the Tulsa Public Schools  where teachers spend almost twice as much time on letter sounds and half as much on fantasy play  presents challenges.Theres a real tension that exists in trying to make the transition seamless, said Steven Dow, executive director of CAP, who has become something of a national leader on early education.Accustomed to intimate classrooms that welcome, even solicit, parent volunteers, Head Start kids often struggle to negotiate the vastly different experience of being dropped off in a circular driveway and herded into a traditional public school.We teach the state standard, so theres a little more meat, academically, said Williams, the pre-K teacher at Kendall-Whittier Elementary. At CAP, yes, they know their letters, but not necessarily how to write their names.Georgetown University researcher William Gormley has spent a decade measuring the outcome of each approach, and finds that children who went through the public-school program do better in early literacy over their Head Start-schooled classmates. (In math, both rate about the same.)But both groups soar ahead of kids whove had no preschool at all.We do not normally think of a relatively poor, relatively conservative state as leading the nation in an important social policy realm, Gormley wrote in Small Miracles, one of his many papers on Tulsa.When Appalachian State beats the University of Michigan, that is news. When Tulsa outshines the rest of the nation in early childhood education, that is also news.Gormley is convinced that the citys 16-year experiment proves that high-quality preschool  of either stripe  can measurably improve readiness for kindergarten. But nagging questions remain, chief among them why much of the pre-K gain appears to fade over time. This fall, Gormley began a study of Tulsas eighth-graders to find out more, though he believes the demographic shifts swamping Oklahoma are a major factor. And, he adds, preschool itself is merely one step in a much longer ladder.I know you folks in Seattle are focusing on 4-year-olds, but your public officials ought to be focusing as much on elementary-school teachers, he said. For a strong pre-K program to have enduring benefits, teachers need to make some adjustments. If they continue to teach the same old stuff in the same old way, then the short-term gains are very likely to evaporate.To wit: at Memorial Junior High, where many eighth-graders have gone through state-funded preschool, overall student outcomes ranked an F on the most recent state report card. Discipline is more of a problem than ever.Do I think pre-K is important? You bet, said Ginger Bunnell, the principal. But not because its going to make us all Einsteins. Are our kids driving off in cars that are not theirs? Yes. Do we have more of this than we used to 12 years ago? Yes. A smattering of 4-year-olds going to an early-education program is not going to set the world on fire.As if to illustrate her point, 16-year-old Trenton Webster pulled up in a pickup a few moments later   with three friends. All said they had been part of Tulsas pre-K program and remembered it fondly. None had been successful in later years. But you cant blame pre-K for that, Webster said. I learned how to read and write and count earlier than I would have, and I think it helped when I was little. My grades were good in elementary. But you make your own decisions. In middle school, I was skipping most of the time.Webster, who should be a junior this year, started ninth grade for the third time last month.Hed already been held back twice.Claudia Rowe: crowe@seattletimes.com or 206-464-2531 On Twitter @RoweReportOriginally published September 20, 2014 at  8:36 PM | Page modified September 23, 2014 at  1:57 PM					TULSA, Okla.

Did everyone get this letter? Seto had already been accepted to the UW as an incoming freshman, but she expected to apply to the College of Engineering at the end of her sophomore year, competing against a thousand other UW students, of which only about 55 percent get in.  So Seto set the letter aside  until somebody at the UW called and convinced her it was for real.Now in her sophomore year, Seto has already been accepted into the industrial engineering department, thanks to the UWs State Academic Red Shirt program, or STARS. In an idea borrowed from college athletics called redshirting, STARS enrolls promising engineering students  many of them women and minorities  to give them an additional year of collegiate academic work before theyre ready for the big time.   A similar program is in its second year at Washington State University.Seto was a perfect candidate. She was good at math and science, did well on the national Advanced Placement calculus exam and graduated in the top 10 percent of her class at her high school in Vancouver, Wash. But her school didnt have strong math and science departments, and the students  standardized test scores were low. Because she was so bright, Seto didnt have much trouble making As.Students like her often dont make the cut for UWs engineering schools. Because engineering has become so competitive, the top candidates tend to be from high schools with high standardized-test scores and rigorous college-level courses.   Those schools also usually have a wealth of extracurricular activities where students further hone their interest in the sciences.In high school, Seto took an aptitude test at school that suggested industrial engineering as a possible career, but she had never even met an engineer before. As a woman, she met STARS goal of bringing a little more balance to engineering programs, which at the UW and elsewhere are dominated by white and Asian men from privileged backgrounds. In 2014, only about 23 percent of the UW students who received bachelors degrees in engineering were women. And only about 7 percent of the UWs 2014 graduates were underrepresented minorities  African-American, Hispanic/Latino, Native American or Hawaiian students.The lack of diversity in computer science and engineering has grabbed headlines in recent months, and most tech companies acknowledge they need to do better. But the problem also tracks back to the universities, where the competition for a slot in engineering is ruthless. Without a program like STARS, funded with a grant from the National Science Foundation, students like Seto have very little time to catch up to better-prepared peers.  With STARS, she has five years to earn her bachelors in engineering, spending the first on prep work aimed at putting her on equal footing with those from more privileged backgrounds.Though its early yet, the program seems to be working.First test a big oneA week before first-quarter midterms at the University of Washington this fall, 15 STARS students clustered around whiteboards in Loew Hall, covering the boards with inky equations.Their mingled voices rose and fell as they worked out problems together, out loud, puzzling through the logic of calculus.Delta-A equals one times A, and divide by 100, and that equals pi R squared ... Delta R is just basically equal to 100 F ... That would be the prime of X ... So, then I just plugged in R ...They are working at a level some of them never reached in high school, even if they did well in math. One reason engineering programs lack diversity, STARS directors say, is that the quality of high-school math instruction at Washington high schools is wildly uneven, with the weaker programs often in low-income schools.For weeks now, professors and instructors have been warning these students, many of whom are the first in their families to attend college, that this first midterm was going to be really difficult  a test of their determination to do the hard work it takes to become engineers. That fact doesnt always sink in until after the test.Last year, for example, Seto thought her AP calculus work in high school had set her up well for engineering, so she was surprised to be placed in a precalculus class as a freshman. Still, she and many other students in STARS failed the first midterm.She quickly realized that college math was going to require a different kind of intensity. There were a lot of times when it got really hard, and then you just look at your fellow STARS peers, and theyre going through the same thing as you, Seto said. You bond over that mutual struggle.Because the major is so competitive, a low score on a math midterm can be enough to torpedo a students dream of becoming an engineer.Theres so much weeding out, said Eve Riskin, associate dean of diversity and access for the UW College of Engineering. The system isnt patient enough, and thats unfortunate.By the end of the first year of STARS, 21 of 30 students had earned at least a 3.0 grade-point average, the minimum needed to gain entry into engineering through STARS. Outside of STARS, students who are accepted into engineering have grade-point averages of 3.37 to 3.78. Pioneering programThe academic redshirt program was first pioneered at the University of Colorado (CU) at Boulder six years ago. The learning curve was steep. Ten students out of the original cohort of 16 did not finish the program. After the first two years, the university retooled it significantly.The university  became more careful about how it selected students, making sure they were up to the challenge, said Tanya Ennis, Engineering GoldShirt director. (CU-Boulder uses gold shirt instead of red shirt because gold is one of the schools colors.)It required all students to live on campus for the first two years. It revamped a precalculus course to better prepare students for the first year of college calculus. The university offered extra scholarship money so students didnt have to work while going through school, and offered financial incentives for those who reached a certain GPA. Three years later, seventy-five percent of students stayed in the program, and last year 80 percent did.Washingtons schools have benefited from CU-Boulders insights about making a big school feel small, teaching math intensively the first year, and helping students understand what engineering is all about. Theyve also drawn on research that makes it clear that navigating college requires much more than just doing well on a calculus test.That research shows that low-income and first-generation students are much more likely to drop out of college than students who come from better-off families  even when academic ability, at least as measured by standardized test scores, is the same.You need to know how to navigate the system, said Sonya Cunningham, an engineer, the director of the UW STARS program, and herself the first in her family to go to college.Some first-generation students want to go home every weekend to study at the kitchen table, like they did in high school. But they will do much better if they stay on campus, surrounded by students studying the same material, and where help is available if they hit a snag, Cunningham said.The challenges can be further magnified at a big school like the UWs Seattle campus, which has the 12th-largest enrollment of any college campus in the country. To make college feel smaller, STARS programs at UW and WSU group about 30 students together in the same classes. At the UW, students are also required to live on campus the first year. Students say it works.We did all of our studying together ... we went to the same classes, Seto said. We got to know each other pretty well.In their first year, students   take classes in study skills and time management as well as math and chemistry.Sophomore Melina Soto, the first in her family to go to college, has learned to do her work early so she can get help if she is stumped. And shes found it especially helpful to go to the UWs Engineering Academic Center, where study groups, often made up of students from diverse backgrounds, puzzle through difficult assignments.Seeking the right studentsThe STARS programs in Washington have had some bumps, too.In summer 2013, the first year STARS opened at UW and WSU, the programs scrambled to find students. WSU, in particular, had less time to find them because, as a school on the semester system, its classes start a month before UWs.A significant number of WSUs first cohort of 30 students werent academically strong enough and just stopped coming to class, said WSU STARS director Jeremy Kingma.This fall, WSU and UW screened applicants with personality tests and essay questions designed to show which students were most likely to persevere in the face of obstacles.WSU looks for students who have a growth mindset, an idea developed by Stanford psychology professor Carol Dweck that emphasizes effort over intelligence or talent. Its not a question of how smart you are, its a question of how hard youre willing to work, said John Schneider, associate dean for undergraduate programs in WSUs Voiland College of Engineering and Architecture. So far this year, only one STARS student has dropped out of the UW program, and none have dropped out at WSU.The programs wont yet make a big change in the racial or gender makeup of their universities engineering programs.   The UW College of Engineering, for example,   accepted 985 students last year  and just 21 of them were from STARS.But the program could be expanded if it proves to be successful, said Riskin, the associate dean of diversity and access for the UWs engineering college.Research shows that we lose women and minorities from engineering because they feel like they dont belong, she said.I could write pages of the times I was made to feel like I didnt belong, just for being a woman  and I came from a family where both parents had gone to college, she added. So the STARS community gives our students the sense of belonging they need.Katherine Long: 206-464-2291 or klong@seattletimes.com.

We got to know each other pretty well.In their first year, students   take classes in study skills and time management as well as math and chemistry.Sophomore Melina Soto, the first in her family to go to college, has learned to do her work early so she can get help if she is stumped. And shes found it especially helpful to go to the UWs Engineering Academic Center, where study groups, often made up of students from diverse backgrounds, puzzle through difficult assignments.Seeking the right studentsThe STARS programs in Washington have had some bumps, too.In summer 2013, the first year STARS opened at UW and WSU, the programs scrambled to find students. WSU, in particular, had less time to find them because, as a school on the semester system, its classes start a month before UWs.A significant number of WSUs first cohort of 30 students werent academically strong enough and just stopped coming to class, said WSU STARS director Jeremy Kingma.This fall, WSU and UW screened applicants with personality tests and essay questions designed to show which students were most likely to persevere in the face of obstacles.WSU looks for students who have a growth mindset, an idea developed by Stanford psychology professor Carol Dweck that emphasizes effort over intelligence or talent. Its not a question of how smart you are, its a question of how hard youre willing to work, said John Schneider, associate dean for undergraduate programs in WSUs Voiland College of Engineering and Architecture. So far this year, only one STARS student has dropped out of the UW program, and none have dropped out at WSU.The programs wont yet make a big change in the racial or gender makeup of their universities engineering programs.   The UW College of Engineering, for example,   accepted 985 students last year  and just 21 of them were from STARS.But the program could be expanded if it proves to be successful, said Riskin, the associate dean of diversity and access for the UWs engineering college.Research shows that we lose women and minorities from engineering because they feel like they dont belong, she said.I could write pages of the times I was made to feel like I didnt belong, just for being a woman  and I came from a family where both parents had gone to college, she added. So the STARS community gives our students the sense of belonging they need.Katherine Long: 206-464-2291 or klong@seattletimes.com.

So Seto set the letter aside  until somebody at the UW called and convinced her it was for real.Now in her sophomore year, Seto has already been accepted into the industrial engineering department, thanks to the UW\s State Academic Red Shirt program, or STARS. In an idea borrowed from college athletics called redshirting, STARS enrolls promising engineering students  many of them women and minorities  to give them an additional year of collegiate academic work before they\re ready for the big time.   A similar program is in its second year at Washington State University.Seto was a perfect candidate. She was good at math and science, did well on the national Advanced Placement calculus exam and graduated in the top 10 percent of her class at her high school in Vancouver, Wash. But her school didn\t have strong math and science departments, and the students\  standardized test scores were low. Because she was so bright, Seto didn\t have much trouble making A\s.Students like her often don\t make the cut for UW\s engineering schools. Because engineering has become so competitive, the top candidates tend to be from high schools with high standardized-test scores and rigorous college-level courses.   Those schools also usually have a wealth of extracurricular activities where students further hone their interest in the sciences.""}]","UW gives future engineers a redshirt season"

Changes in the brainIn Berningers lab, she and Richards are working on helping older children who struggle with reading, investigating whether specialized instruction developed at the UW can help them.But they are building on other studies that show teaching 4- and 5-year-olds to write and name the letters of the alphabet improves their reading later on.The basic idea is this: Naming the letters and physically making them stroke by stroke in preschool helps children notice and remember their differences.Berninger and Richards give children tests and brain scans before and after the specialized instruction, which they receive via computer, so researchers can figure out if anything has changed in their brains. Shelter was back in the lab for her follow-up scan.She loves math and studies hard, but she struggled so much with reading and spelling that she broke down in tears one day toward the end of second grade.Her mother, Sarah Gimbel, also a UW professor, knew that Shelter was a bright kid, but dyslexia runs in her family, so she signed up her daughter for Berningers study.As Shelter wrote letters,  Richards scanned her brain using magnetic resonance imaging, which analyzes signals that the brains soft tissues emit when radio waves wash over them in a strong but harmless magnetic field.Using sophisticated computer software, he can generate images of the brains structure and map which areas consume more energy during a particular task. He can also develop images showing the nerve fiber tracts that connect those areas.Researchers believe that those spaghetti-like bundles help form complex and partially overlapping circuits that connect the brains systems for vision, spoken language and movement, all of which are used when we read.Those circuits become more efficient and automatic over time, which makes reading and writing a seamless experience.When children with language-learning disabilities read and write, those tasks activate  specific locations of their brains differently than in their typically developing peers.Berninger and Richards prior research showed that after dyslexic children received specialized reading and writing instruction, those brain differences often disappeared and their reading and writing improved.Now they want to explore those changes in more detail to see if computerized reading and writing instruction can normalize not only the activity of different parts of the brain, but the connections between them.Learning languageIn a nearby lab, Kuhl, one of the worlds leading experts on speech development, focuses on infants and toddlers  specifically how the connections in their brains change as they learn language. An adult brain has an estimated 86 billion neurons, which can each have as many as 1,000 to 10,000 connections with other neurons.Kuhl studies how genetics combine with early experiences to forge efficient circuits through those thickets of connections the way that a path emerges in the woods from constant use.For example, she has found, in work that is not yet published, that the ability of 6-month-olds to tune in to the sounds of their native language  like the subtle difference between pat and bat  predicts a skill at age 5 that corresponds strongly with reading success.Academics call that skill phonological awareness, which is the ability to think about the different sounds in a word and how they are ordered.Kuhl discovered to her surprise that it wasnt some raw biological talent for discriminating sounds that predicted later speech and reading success.Rather, what mattered was the babies ability to focus on sounds that were relevant to learning their native language while also ignoring irrelevant sounds.Those two dimensions of attention  locking in on whats important while ignoring distractions  predicted both how well they would speak at age 2½ as well as their phonological awareness at age 5.Parents direct their babies attention to whats important with lots of warm, loving, face-to-face talk using that kind of singsong voice that dips and rises and stretches out vowel sounds.And parents strengthen those connections as their children grow by reading aloud to them, asking open-ended questions, and practicing serve-and-return conversations that build vocabulary and basic knowledge about the world around them.Children who have even one adult spending time with them like that can form those connections, regardless of family wealth and education, Kuhl said.Its not a fancy toy or a television set; its you and your time, Kuhl said. Your kids brain is not a turnkey system; it really does require you to talk and play and challenge cognitively.Putting research to useParents and  teachers can use the insights from Berninger and Kuhls research to help children build stronger foundations for future learning and even prevent some problems before kindergarten.For example, to strengthen phonological awareness, kids in preschool might play rhyming games and clap out the syllables of a silly song. But teachers should stay away from drilling phonics, a more fine-tuned ability to match letters and sounds, Berninger says.Childrens brains generally arent mature enough for phonics until kindergarten, which is why simply shoving the kindergarten curriculum down to preschool isnt likely to be effective, she said.Theres an awful lot of this craziness trying to teach phonics to 2-, 3- and 4-year-olds, Berninger said. Instead, preschool should be about practicing all the ways that the brain experiences language  hearing it, speaking it, seeing it and writing it  while having  fun along the way.Kids can build brain connections for writing by molding clay, which improves finger strength, or tracing a maze, which increases muscle control.Preschool also should provide lots of opportunities to play, explore, listen to stories, look at the pictures and written words, and talk about what they hear, Berninger said.Many problems, such as difficulty writing and naming letters, can be spotted by a trained preschool or elementary teacher, and often eliminated or at least improved with  instruction similar to what Berningers group has developed.

Rainier Beach kids, many of whom entered high school performing below grade level, would never succeed on the college track, they said. The school was an incubator for star athletes, not serious scholars.But early results are crushing those predictions as soundly as a slam dunk.No marker is more stunning than Beachs 25-point increase in graduation rates since 2011. Last spring, 79 percent of seniors left with a diploma  better than the 74 percent district average.Parents, once so wary of Beachs reputation for gangs and lackluster academics that they were willing to pay for private school or drive 20 miles north for advanced classes, are beginning to reconsider. Projected enrollment next fall at Rainier Beach is higher than it has been in a decade.When I was a freshman, I would have cleaned sewers rather than come here, said Hussein Abshir, now a senior. Id heard the rumors so I came with really low expectations  I would have gone to North Seattle, or even Bainbridge Island.Instead, Abshir spent his junior year puzzling through Josef Stalins rise to power in an International Baccalaureate history class; being taught computer code by programmers from Microsoft; and envisioning himself as a student at the University of Washington Bothell, where he has been accepted for next fall.But his enthusiasm, and that of the 130 Rainier Beach students recommended for IB courses next year, bumps up against a discomfiting fact: Seattle Public Schools does not consider the program part of the districts official Advanced Learning options, and has no plans to fund IB beyond the startup grant that Rainier Beach will exhaust in 2017.In other words the International Baccalaureate, despite its encouraging results, is an extra, something that parents at other schools eventually end up paying for.When we started, there wasnt necessarily a vision at the district level for how we would sustain this, said Colin Pierce, who manages the IB program at Rainier Beach. That does raise the question of how Seattle uses advanced learning  is it just a student-sorting mechanism? Or can it be a way to address equity?Push from parentsPopular with the children of diplomats, the International Baccalaureate came to Rainier Beach largely at the insistence of South End parents desperate to make the school more attractive to families.Enrollment had dwindled to 366 students  a quarter the size of most local high schools  when Pierce began the arduous, three-year application process for IB certification. Opening those classes to all students, even those who would not pursue the full diploma, was part of his plan from the start, so every junior and senior now takes IB Language Arts.Simultaneously, Principal Dwane Chappelle hired more than a dozen new faculty, all of whom have been trained in IBs deep-inquiry approach to wrestling with intellectual questions.The new crop includes algebra teacher Adam Christopulos, who started four years ago with just a few tables in his classroom, because no one anticipated that hed ever have more than 18 students.Now the room is packed.We still have work to do, he said. But because the atmosphere has changed, it changes the attitude of my students. They think, Im at this school with a high-level program, and they act different.Despite the sense of evolution, Rainier Beach is no prep academy. Students sometimes doze in class.

Last week, a senior backed away from attempting an IB diploma  the required research paper was just too much.Nevertheless, Tavares Tagaleoo, 17, says the overall climate is more serious, more scholarly, and he credits IB.It was really a shock, going from this laid-back place into a real academic school, he said. I was hesitant at first, kind of intimidated. But IB is the reason why I come every day. I dont honestly think Id still be in school if it wasnt for IB and how it challenged me.Nowadays, Pierce travels the country helping educators in other high-poverty communities make similar transitions, part of an effort on the part of the international organization to bring its high-rigor approach to more low-income kids. The number of them seeking an IB diploma has nearly doubled since 2010.But in Seattle, where academically tracked schools often split along racial lines, access to IB is an especially sensitive issue.We want to make sure our International Baccalaureate students reflect the demographics of the whole school, said Rita Green, a former Beach parent who now chairs the Seattle/King County NAACP Education Committee. We dont want it to be like Garfield, where you have two schools in one building  one for white and one for blacks.Little danger of that. Rainier Beach has few white students. It is paying for IB with a combination of federal and district grants that will last only two more years.Seattles other IB high schools  Ingraham and Chief Sealth  spent their district grants long ago and now depend on parent funding or building-level dollars to sustain their programs.But Rainier Beach has twice as many as low-income students as Ingraham, 30 percent more than Sealth and far less money-raising muscle than either.Im very concerned, said Nerissa Hallberg, the academic dean. Were in this defining moment. But it could all be up in the air when the money runs out.InequitiesHer worry pokes at old wounds, still raw.Rainier Beach families have long considered themselves ignored by the school district, so two months ago when parents began complaining that IB biology students had no textbooks, their concerns echoed loudly.Were students getting a watered-down version of the curriculum? Did the high-polish program exist in name only? (Answer: Science teacher Karla Nyquist requested new textbooks after the Christmas break and made Xeroxes for her students in the interim. But parents remain skeptical. And the books have yet to arrive.)IB has to mean something, agreed Paul Campbell, who directs national outreach for the program. There was a time when low-income schools adopted IB, and it was cosmetic more than anything. A community has to trust that their school is being held to rigorous standards.To ensure this, each IB school must conduct a detailed self-study every five years, noting how many students take the courses and tracking their performance. Sometimes those reports trigger a visit from central office staff. Once in a while they result in revoked certification.Pierce, meanwhile, is trying to rein in expectations among the first Beach seniors to take a full IB course load. That group started at 19 but now numbers eight as some, juggling the curriculums demands, have fallen away.(During its first year Ingraham had seven IB diploma candidates, only two of whom passed all of the tests. At Chief Sealth, five out of 14 first-year scholars earned an IB diploma.)Obviously, its a nice feather in the cap, Pierce said. But our primary measure of success right now is access to the curriculum, not the test scores.No need to sell Justin Jones, 15. He has never been on an airplane before, but will fly to Spain this summer as one of 10 Rainier Beach students discussing global technology with other college-bound kids at the IB World Conference in Barcelona.His old classmates down the street at South Shore Middle School would be stunned.Most of them wanted to stay away from Beach, Jones said. But I really wanted to seek out this higher form of education. Nobody in my familys graduated college  it just means a lot to me.Plain-spoken about his aspirations, the sophomore is typical of students newly attracted to Rainier Beach. The hallways where kids used to roughhouse are now silent during class. Parents who strained to send their boys to Catholic school find their children begging to attend the neighborhood legacy.I couldnt believe it, actually, said Sherrill Vaughan, who considers herself a staunch advocate for South Seattle yet discouraged her son from attending Beach. The old reputation was just too troubling, she said.Vaughan spoke while watching a block of gelatin soak up pink-tinted sodium hydroxide, listening as Pierce and Nyquist taught an IB science lesson to parents considering the IB route for their kids. At first a gloomy gray, the gelatin cubes turned pale pink, then bright, then Day-Glo.Intended as a visual representation of cellular surface area principles, for Vaughan the exercise was just more evidence of transformation underway.My mind has been changed, she said. Her son entered the school last fall.Rainier Beach, once considered the worst high school in Seattle, now has graduation rates that top the districts.Tangled in bureaucracy and tradition, public schools need years  often the better part of a decade  for real turnaround, so skeptics may wave off the spike in graduation rates at Rainier Beach High as a mere blip.Or ignore its ballooning enrollment.Or shrug at the dozens of students on track to leave with college credit for advanced studies.In the past two years, all of these things have happened at Seattles long-languishing South End school, and all trace back to the moment when Rainier Beach gambled on a rigorous curriculum with a fancy name and high-end pedigree: the International Baccalaureate.Outsiders have been dismissive from the start.

But parents remain skeptical. And the books have yet to arrive.)IB has to mean something, agreed Paul Campbell, who directs national outreach for the program. There was a time when low-income schools adopted IB, and it was cosmetic more than anything. A community has to trust that their school is being held to rigorous standards.To ensure this, each IB school must conduct a detailed self-study every five years, noting how many students take the courses and tracking their performance. Sometimes those reports trigger a visit from central office staff. Once in a while they result in revoked certification.Pierce, meanwhile, is trying to rein in expectations among the first Beach seniors to take a full IB course load. That group started at 19 but now numbers eight as some, juggling the curriculums demands, have fallen away.(During its first year Ingraham had seven IB diploma candidates, only two of whom passed all of the tests. At Chief Sealth, five out of 14 first-year scholars earned an IB diploma.)Obviously, its a nice feather in the cap, Pierce said. But our primary measure of success right now is access to the curriculum, not the test scores.No need to sell Justin Jones, 15. He has never been on an airplane before, but will fly to Spain this summer as one of 10 Rainier Beach students discussing global technology with other college-bound kids at the IB World Conference in Barcelona.His old classmates down the street at South Shore Middle School would be stunned.Most of them wanted to stay away from Beach, Jones said. But I really wanted to seek out this higher form of education. Nobody in my familys graduated college  it just means a lot to me.Plain-spoken about his aspirations, the sophomore is typical of students newly attracted to Rainier Beach. The hallways where kids used to roughhouse are now silent during class. Parents who strained to send their boys to Catholic school find their children begging to attend the neighborhood legacy.I couldnt believe it, actually, said Sherrill Vaughan, who considers herself a staunch advocate for South Seattle yet discouraged her son from attending Beach. The old reputation was just too troubling, she said.Vaughan spoke while watching a block of gelatin soak up pink-tinted sodium hydroxide, listening as Pierce and Nyquist taught an IB science lesson to parents considering the IB route for their kids. At first a gloomy gray, the gelatin cubes turned pale pink, then bright, then Day-Glo.Intended as a visual representation of cellular surface area principles, for Vaughan the exercise was just more evidence of transformation underway.My mind has been changed, she said. Her son entered the school last fall.","[{""tag"":""problem"",""text"":""Rainier Beach, once considered the worst high school in Seattle, now has graduation rates that top the district\s.Tangled in bureaucracy and tradition, public schools need years  often the better part of a decade  for real turnaround, so skeptics may wave off the spike in graduation rates at Rainier Beach High as a mere blip.Or ignore its ballooning enrollment.Or shrug at the dozens of students on track to leave with college credit for advanced studies.In the past two years, all of these things have happened at Seattle\s long-languishing South End school, and all trace back to the moment when Rainier Beach gambled on a rigorous curriculum with a fancy name and high-end pedigree: the International Baccalaureate.Outsiders have been dismissive from the start.

He also points out the academic fade-out that has been documented in a number of places.

A new system of in-depth observation by trained evaluators and principals, soon to be required in schools across Washington, shows what can help.After playing outside on a blustery December morning, the toddlers at Happy Tots Childcare in Renton plopped down for circle time.What had they noticed in the yard, their teacher, Benaz Amin, asked.Wind? she prompted. Remember? It blew all the toys around.They smiled, but said nothing, so she moved on.Watching from a corner of the room, evaluator Elaine Jackson made a mental note: Amin had missed an opportunity for the kind of conversation that builds learning.Amin might have asked the children, for example, what the wind did to the trees or whether they had ever lost power at home.Jackson is part of a growing effort to solve a tough problem: how to accurately and fairly critique teaching in ways that helps teachers improve.The art of teaching has long been considered something of a black box  a matter of personal style, intuition and philosophy that couldnt be defined, much less reliably measured.But now the lid is starting to come off.Trained observers like Jackson  armed with elaborate guides that describe what good teaching looks like and how to rate it  are changing the way teachers are evaluated, not only in preschool but in K-12 classrooms.These new, in-depth observations are replacing or supplementing the ways teachers have been judged in the past, most often with superficial visits by school principals.The goal is to make teacher evaluations more objective than a principals opinion and more useful for self-improvement than a ranking based on student test scores.The state has been rolling the new guides out slowly  both in a new quality rating system for early childhood education and in public-school districts.By the fall of this year, all K-12 principals must, under state law, judge teachers using one of three guides, which are all based on teaching practices with a track record for effectiveness.In the early education world, the state is using a fourth tool, called CLASS, which is backed by some of the deepest and highest quality research to date showing that it can improve both teaching and student achievement.Weve now done four different experimental trials for this from preschool to high school and its worked every single time to improve the quality of interactions of the classroom and improve childrens learning, said CLASS co-creator Robert Pianta, dean of the University of Virginia School of Education.Focus on interactionsMore than 20 years ago, Pianta and his colleagues set out to answer basic questions: What matters most in preschool and how can it be measured reliably?Preschools traditionally had been judged by whether their electrical outlets had safety plugs and other stuff that was easy to count, like books on the shelves and blocks in the bins. Teaching quality? Not so much.Up until that point, there were observations done all the time, but they were observations of stuff in the room, Pianta said. There were not observations of what the teachers were doing. So the CLASS really stood that on its head.Pianta, a psychology professor and former seventh-grade teacher, focused on the way that children learn from their parents  their first and most important teachers.He and his colleagues already knew from decades of research that strong parent-child bonds encourage children to venture from the safety of a warm lap to learn about their world.Those moment-to-moment interactions between parents and children lay the foundations for skills that become even more important later, such as paying attention, persistence and self-control.So they extended that idea to teacher-child interactions, categorizing them into three broad areas based on what research has shown to be key to childrens emotional, social and intellectual growth.In the emotional-growth category, they listed interactions that make children feel welcome and safe, recognize their needs and respond to their interests.In the second, they placed examples of good social instruction, in which teachers prevent or defuse misbehavior and orchestrate smooth transitions so kids arent standing around.The third  which was hardest for most teachers  focused on instructional interactions that boost intellectual growth.But evaluators do more than just count the number of open-ended questions a teacher asks or how often they connect concepts to something in a childs everyday life.You cant gauge it on the teachers behavior in isolation, Pianta said. You have to be able to watch the impact of the interaction on the child and then watch what the teacher does in response to the child.Once the CLASS researchers had their yardstick, they tested it in two large-scale studies and found that it was a good gauge of strong instruction.They found that students entering kindergarten scored higher on tests of language and cognitive ability when their teachers had scored higher on CLASS.Many other studies of CLASS  though not all  have found similar associations.The team has since developed similar tools for elementary, middle and high schools  although not soon enough to be included among Washingtons approved guides.One surprising finding: In the tens of thousands of classrooms that CLASS researchers have observed, they see the same pattern  teachers score better on supporting emotional growth and managing behavior than they do on providing instruction.CLASS researchers, in other words, have concluded that most teaching is mediocre or worse, with teachers doing most of the talking and students filling out work sheets.The good news is that those interactions can be improved.One of the strongest CLASS studies showed that middle- and high-school teachers who were randomly assigned to a yearlong, CLASS-based training program appeared to teach better the following year.The 2011 study, published in the journal Science, found that the students of the CLASS-trained teachers scored higher on math, English, science and history exams than the students of teachers who received the districts typical in-service training.The difference was about 10 percentage points.We do actually know what works and its not just your personal style, said Kellie Morrill, an administrator at Educare School of Greater Seattle, a highly rated program that has used CLASS for years.One of Educares most veteran teachers, Judy Somerville, has seen decades of Ivory Tower fads come and go, with teachers rolling their eyes and muttering this too shall pass.CLASS isnt one of those things, Somerville said. It gives us real concrete information about where to put our interest and our focus.Not a cure-allIn practice, this is how a CLASS evaluation works:Observers like Jackson are trained in how to identify strong instruction so they can rate it accurately and consistently.Then they go into classrooms, where they typically watch a teacher for one or two hours. They observe for 20 minutes at a time, then take about 10 minutes to rate the interactions theyve noted before starting a new cycle.They focus on everything teachers do and say, whether its asking kids questions about the block tower theyre building or simply giving an upset child a hug.Jackson remembers one teacher who leaned up against a window sill with her arms crossed while the children played.My score sheet was almost blank because there just werent any words, any interactions, Jackson said.At Tiny Tots in Renton, on the other hand, Jackson noted approvingly how Amin, the teacher, talked with her charges, three boys from ages 2 to 3, while they slurped Kix cereal.Amin leaned in while one boy, Liam, whispered that he saw a big tree outside the window.What else? she asked.A car, Liam whispered.A car. Oooh. What kind of car do you see outside? she asked.Thats the kind of serve-and-return exchange that typically receives high marks.Yet for all its strengths, CLASS is not a cure-all, said University of Washington professor Gail Joseph, who works closely with Piantas group and helped develop the states quality rating system for preschools and child-care centers.Sometimes observers miss something, for example, or catch teachers on a bad day.Joseph also said CLASS is not well-suited for students who are learning English as a second language. And University of Florida researchers say that CLASS doesnt measure the kind of highly structured teaching that some students with disabilities need.A large teacher-evaluation study funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation concluded that observational guides like CLASS work best when teachers are observed multiple times by multiple observers, which is costly.Dan Goldhaber, a professor at UW Bothell who specializes in evaluating teacher performance, worries that the K-12 guides Washington school districts are using wont be useful because they may not pick up differences in teaching quality.Early results from the eight pilot districts in Washington state trying out the new guides showed that no teacher was rated unsatisfactory.Unless your judgment is that all teachers are equally successful, youve got to have your measure of teacher performance show differentiation, Goldhaber said.Struggling teachers were deliberately excluded from the pilot program, which researchers say skews the results.But the initial ratings may also reflect principals inexperience using the new tools, said Stephen Fink, executive director of the UW Center for Educational Leadership, which developed one of the three systems that K-12 public schools must use.People say that teaching isnt rocket science and I would argue that its actually more complicated than rocket science, Fink said.Funding at stake?The stakes for using the tools correctly are high.The federal government uses CLASS to rate Head Start preschools and programs, and the ones that score very low risk losing their contracts.Washington state is considering restricting state subsidies for preschool and child care to programs that earn at least 3 out of 5 stars from the Early Achievers quality rating system, in which CLASS scores weigh heavily. So is the city of Seattle.Of the three other systems that public-school districts are using  mostly one developed by former teacher and economist Charlotte Danielson and the one developed by Finks group at the UW  none have been tested as widely as CLASS.But next school year, the U.S. Department of Education will put the UWs tool to the test in 100 elementary schools across the country, with principals in half the schools randomly assigned to receive coaching from the UWs Center for Educational Leadership and the other half serving as a control group.Researchers want to know if the training causes improvements in student achievement.Meanwhile, the Anacortes School District, which has worked closely with UW to test the UW evaluation system, has some anecdotal evidence that students are doing better, said Cindy Simonsen, director of learning and instruction.The biggest immediate benefit, she said, is that principals and teachers are better able to talk about teaching using the guide as a common reference.Principals always have been able to fire bad teachers, she said, but until now havent had much to say to a teacher who was satisfactory but wanted to do better.We have a lot of teachers who want to be above average, Simonsen said.And Amin at Happy Tots Childcare?She says participating in the Early Achiever program  which provides free coaching to teachers preparing for the in-person CLASS evaluation  improved her teaching.Last week, she received her rating  3 out of 5 stars, which the state considers excellent, with room to grow.How to help teachers improve? A new system of in-depth observation by trained evaluators and principals, soon to be required in schools across Washington, shows what can help.After playing outside on a blustery December morning, the toddlers at Happy Tots Childcare in Renton plopped down for circle time.What had they noticed in the yard, their teacher, Benaz Amin, asked.Wind? she prompted.

So the CLASS really stood that on its head.Pianta, a psychology professor and former seventh-grade teacher, focused on the way that children learn from their parents  their first and most important teachers.He and his colleagues already knew from decades of research that strong parent-child bonds encourage children to venture from the safety of a warm lap to learn about their world.Those moment-to-moment interactions between parents and children lay the foundations for skills that become even more important later, such as paying attention, persistence and self-control.So they extended that idea to teacher-child interactions, categorizing them into three broad areas based on what research has shown to be key to childrens emotional, social and intellectual growth.In the emotional-growth category, they listed interactions that make children feel welcome and safe, recognize their needs and respond to their interests.In the second, they placed examples of good social instruction, in which teachers prevent or defuse misbehavior and orchestrate smooth transitions so kids arent standing around.The third  which was hardest for most teachers  focused on instructional interactions that boost intellectual growth.But evaluators do more than just count the number of open-ended questions a teacher asks or how often they connect concepts to something in a childs everyday life.You cant gauge it on the teachers behavior in isolation, Pianta said. You have to be able to watch the impact of the interaction on the child and then watch what the teacher does in response to the child.Once the CLASS researchers had their yardstick, they tested it in two large-scale studies and found that it was a good gauge of strong instruction.They found that students entering kindergarten scored higher on tests of language and cognitive ability when their teachers had scored higher on CLASS.Many other studies of CLASS  though not all  have found similar associations.The team has since developed similar tools for elementary, middle and high schools  although not soon enough to be included among Washingtons approved guides.One surprising finding: In the tens of thousands of classrooms that CLASS researchers have observed, they see the same pattern  teachers score better on supporting emotional growth and managing behavior than they do on providing instruction.CLASS researchers, in other words, have concluded that most teaching is mediocre or worse, with teachers doing most of the talking and students filling out work sheets.The good news is that those interactions can be improved.One of the strongest CLASS studies showed that middle- and high-school teachers who were randomly assigned to a yearlong, CLASS-based training program appeared to teach better the following year.The 2011 study, published in the journal Science, found that the students of the CLASS-trained teachers scored higher on math, English, science and history exams than the students of teachers who received the districts typical in-service training.The difference was about 10 percentage points.We do actually know what works and its not just your personal style, said Kellie Morrill, an administrator at Educare School of Greater Seattle, a highly rated program that has used CLASS for years.One of Educares most veteran teachers, Judy Somerville, has seen decades of Ivory Tower fads come and go, with teachers rolling their eyes and muttering this too shall pass.CLASS isnt one of those things, Somerville said. It gives us real concrete information about where to put our interest and our focus.Not a cure-allIn practice, this is how a CLASS evaluation works:Observers like Jackson are trained in how to identify strong instruction so they can rate it accurately and consistently.Then they go into classrooms, where they typically watch a teacher for one or two hours. They observe for 20 minutes at a time, then take about 10 minutes to rate the interactions theyve noted before starting a new cycle.They focus on everything teachers do and say, whether its asking kids questions about the block tower theyre building or simply giving an upset child a hug.Jackson remembers one teacher who leaned up against a window sill with her arms crossed while the children played.My score sheet was almost blank because there just werent any words, any interactions, Jackson said.At Tiny Tots in Renton, on the other hand, Jackson noted approvingly how Amin, the teacher, talked with her charges, three boys from ages 2 to 3, while they slurped Kix cereal.Amin leaned in while one boy, Liam, whispered that he saw a big tree outside the window.What else? she asked.A car, Liam whispered.A car. Oooh. What kind of car do you see outside? she asked.Thats the kind of serve-and-return exchange that typically receives high marks.Yet for all its strengths, CLASS is not a cure-all, said University of Washington professor Gail Joseph, who works closely with Piantas group and helped develop the states quality rating system for preschools and child-care centers.Sometimes observers miss something, for example, or catch teachers on a bad day.Joseph also said CLASS is not well-suited for students who are learning English as a second language. And University of Florida researchers say that CLASS doesnt measure the kind of highly structured teaching that some students with disabilities need.A large teacher-evaluation study funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation concluded that observational guides like CLASS work best when teachers are observed multiple times by multiple observers, which is costly.Dan Goldhaber, a professor at UW Bothell who specializes in evaluating teacher performance, worries that the K-12 guides Washington school districts are using wont be useful because they may not pick up differences in teaching quality.Early results from the eight pilot districts in Washington state trying out the new guides showed that no teacher was rated unsatisfactory.Unless your judgment is that all teachers are equally successful, youve got to have your measure of teacher performance show differentiation, Goldhaber said.Struggling teachers were deliberately excluded from the pilot program, which researchers say skews the results.But the initial ratings may also reflect principals inexperience using the new tools, said Stephen Fink, executive director of the UW Center for Educational Leadership, which developed one of the three systems that K-12 public schools must use.People say that teaching isnt rocket science and I would argue that its actually more complicated than rocket science, Fink said.Funding at stake?The stakes for using the tools correctly are high.The federal government uses CLASS to rate Head Start preschools and programs, and the ones that score very low risk losing their contracts.Washington state is considering restricting state subsidies for preschool and child care to programs that earn at least 3 out of 5 stars from the Early Achievers quality rating system, in which CLASS scores weigh heavily. So is the city of Seattle.Of the three other systems that public-school districts are using  mostly one developed by former teacher and economist Charlotte Danielson and the one developed by Finks group at the UW  none have been tested as widely as CLASS.But next school year, the U.S. Department of Education will put the UWs tool to the test in 100 elementary schools across the country, with principals in half the schools randomly assigned to receive coaching from the UWs Center for Educational Leadership and the other half serving as a control group.Researchers want to know if the training causes improvements in student achievement.Meanwhile, the Anacortes School District, which has worked closely with UW to test the UW evaluation system, has some anecdotal evidence that students are doing better, said Cindy Simonsen, director of learning and instruction.The biggest immediate benefit, she said, is that principals and teachers are better able to talk about teaching using the guide as a common reference.Principals always have been able to fire bad teachers, she said, but until now havent had much to say to a teacher who was satisfactory but wanted to do better.We have a lot of teachers who want to be above average, Simonsen said.And Amin at Happy Tots Childcare?She says participating in the Early Achiever program  which provides free coaching to teachers preparing for the in-person CLASS evaluation  improved her teaching.Last week, she received her rating  3 out of 5 stars, which the state considers excellent, with room to grow.","[{""tag"":""problem"",""text"":"" in the yard, their teacher, Benaz Amin, asked.\Wind?\ she prompted. \Remember?

Supporters point to a    2013 study by the nonprofit RAND Corp., which concluded that prisoners who participated in education programs were 43 percent less likely to return to prison within three years of release, and also found that every dollar spent on inmate education translated to $4 to $5 saved on re-incarceration.The study couldnt unravel whether college classes made the difference, because it looked at all levels of schooling, including GEDs and vocational education. But studies being done now are tackling   that question. In the meantime, participating academics believe theyre making a difference  for the inmates and society as a whole.Teaching in prison is the most fulfilling thing Ive ever done, said Reid Helford, a sociologist with a Ph.D. from Loyola University in Chicago, who teaches sociology to inmates at the Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla.Education does more than offer inmates a credential, he added, saying it teaches them how to be the people we want our fellow citizens to be  thoughtful, critically aware of the world around them, disciplined and able to recognize authority.Visiting professorsOne morning this fall, Robin Jacobson, an assistant professor of politics and government at the University of Puget Sound (UPS), stood before 16 inmates at the Washington Corrections Center for Women near Gig Harbor, lecturing about how a bill works its way through Congress. The women, dressed in gray sweats with prison IDs clipped to their shirts, followed her closely  taking notes, frequently raising their hands to offer observations or ask questions.Does the president need Senate consent to fire a cabinet member? What is the importance of presidential signing statements?How could Jimmy Carter have won the 1976 election if popularity is an important component of political power?Great questions, Jacobson said, beaming.Her course is offered through the privately funded Freedom Education Project of Puget Sound (FEPPS). Twelve professors from UPS, the University of Washington, Seattle Pacific University, Tacoma Community College and Harvard Extension School receive a stipend of $1,200 per semester to pay for transportation to and from the prison. UPS students serve as study-hall tutors.The women inmates themselves asked for the classes.   Theyd heard from former prisoners   that vocational certificates didnt always translate into jobs, and they wanted something more meaningful.The fundamental question is, what do we expect from our justice system? asked Alyssa Knight, a student and inmate in her early 30s who expects to be released in 2025, 22 years after her conviction in the murder and attempted robbery of a suspected drug dealer.Do you expect it to rehabilitate a person? asked Knight. If you are just basically warehousing people, then you are not going to get a change.Tanya Erzen, executive director of FEPPS and an associate professor of religion at UPS, echoed a theme voiced by others who teach behind bars: Many inmates seem to value an education more fervently than the typical college student, for whom going to college was always a given.According to a FEPPS survey, 78 percent of the women in the program have been victims of domestic violence. More than 40 percent are high-school dropouts. In the past two years, 250 women have taken courses through FEPPS. Currently, 37 women are working toward a college degree.The program is so popular that it has a waiting list of about 50.Public money off-limitsBefore 1994, there were about 350 college prison programs nationwide, run by public colleges and universities.    But then Congress eliminated federal student Pell Grant aid to prisoners, the source of money that had paid for college classes behind bars. In 1995, Washington lawmakers followed suit with a ban on using tax money for  postsecondary education in prison. The same law expressly requires inmates to earn the equivalent of a high-school diploma. Inmates are also encouraged to learn vocational skills through classes taught by the states community colleges. That carries an annual price tag of about $15.5 million, or about $939 for each of the states 16,500 inmates.But academic college courses are off-limits, except for the privately funded programs that are offered in just four of the states prisons, and for the correspondence courses for inmates who can afford them.Last year, 980 inmates completed a high-school equivalency degree, and inmates also earned a total of 1,812 vocational certificates. But just 47 finished a two-year college degree. College-level courses started creeping back into Washington prisons in 2005, when a private group, University Behind Bars, began offering them at the Monroe Correctional Complex. Then in 2008, an inmate at the Walla Walla prison wrote to business magnate Warren Buffett and implored him to fund classes in the states oldest prison.The letter found its way to Warren Buffetts sister Doris, who supported prison education in New York through her charity, the Sunshine Lady Foundation. Doris Buffett agreed to pay for a small program at Walla Walla, and later extended it to Coyote Ridge Corrections Center near the Tri-Cities. University Behind Bars has also expanded, and now reaches nearly 200 inmates in two units of the Monroe Correctional Complex. Finding some controlParadoxically, for some, prison is a good place to go to college.Behind bars, distractions are minimized and the structure of prison life makes it more likely that inmates will finish their educations, said Henry Richards, a Seattle forensic psychologist in private practice. Richards is the liaison between the Buffett foundation and the Walla Walla prison. For many who ran afoul of the law, he said, going to school   was like prison itself  regimentation, boredom, the main emphasis is on control and being told youve failed. But while behind bars, he said, education becomes a way for inmates to control their futures.Helford, the Walla Walla Community College adjunct who teaches both GED and college-level classes at the state penitentiary, said many inmates in his courses undergo a transformation.When they first start his classes, theres something raw about them as students, he said. They really dont know how to be a good student  how to behave in the classroom, how to present an argument, how to talk intelligently.They come in angry, he said, knowing everything. But after a few semesters, they change from a somewhat immature kid to someone who has some poise, can speak intelligently, knows how to learn about something.Helford and Richards both acknowledge that the inmates who want college-level work may be the most academically capable men and women in the state prison system.As such, they may be least likely to ever reoffend, no matter what kind of education they get in prison.Still, two decades after funding for prison education was stripped away, there is a deep understanding that college in prison was a good thing, and that its sorely missed, said Vivian Nixon, executive director of the College & Community Fellowship, a New York-based nonprofit involved in prison education advocacy.In the past, she said, inmates enrolled in college courses often mentored prisoners working on their high-school diplomas. There was a better culture of learning  not just in education but in treatment programs for substance abuse, parenting programs, work training programs, she said.Over the years, some Washington legislators have tried to amend the law so some state money could be used for college-level classes. But strong opposition still exists. A 2013 bill, for example, would have allowed the Department of Corrections to carve money out of its budget to pay for prison education, but the bill died in committee.In New York last year, Gov. Andrew Cuomos proposal to provide basic financing for college-education programs in that states prisons also went nowhere. One lawmaker called it a slap in the face to hardworking New Yorkers struggling to send their kids to college.TransformationsInmates who   take college classes say that wrestling with big ideas stretches their intellectual muscles and relieves the monotony of prison life.To do homework in their cells, they must turn off the TV and put away the playing cards. When classes took off at the womens prison, inmates put aside their complaints about prison life and began discussing English literature, or comparative religion, or American history. It pervaded our existence in here  it started to transform what people were thinking about, said Knight, the inmate who is serving time for the murder of a drug dealer in Spokane.Richards said a similar thing happened at the Walla Walla prison, as racial conflict and antagonism  hallmarks of prison life  were pushed to the background while inmates focused on their coursework.The professors say they dont dumb down the coursework for their prison classes. For most inmates, thats meant having to step up their writing skills, and take remedial math. Marriam Oliver, an inmate at the womens prison,   has been locked up since she was 14 years old, after she and four other teens and an adult were convicted of killing an Everett man in 2001.    One of her triumphs in prison was reading Virginia Woolf, and then discussing the English novelists work with a college-going family member who came to visit.You see a lot of people coming back to prison, and a lot of that has to do with their education, said Oliver, who is scheduled to be released in 2023. And I refuse to be one of those people that didnt take advantage of opportunities. A five-year study now under way will help determine if she is right.The Pathways from Prison to Postsecondary Education Project, led by the nonprofit Vera Institute of Justice,   is studying whether a college education in prison is a good investment.Researchers hope to build on the earlier RAND study, which was unable to disentangle the effects of all the different types of education programs  basic remedial education, vocational training, and college-level courses. This demonstration project is an important opportunity to get inside the black box to really understand what program elements and dosage is associated with different outcomes, said Lois Davis, one of the RAND reports authors. But advocates  and some inmates  are already convinced.Tanya Wilson is working on her degree while serving two consecutive 10-year terms for two counts of second-degree murder  in Washington.    She   believes that inmates who complete a college education may be better equipped to break the cycle of crime in their families that leads them to prison in the first place.Who would you rather live beside, she asked, a person thats just getting out of prison who just sat in her cell and stewed, or do you want somebody who has transformed, who is educated, who will not be a drain on society?

Researchers generally agree that lower class sizes, at least in the earliest grades, are linked to positive educational benefits such as better test scores, fewer dropouts and higher graduation rates, especially for disadvantaged children.They disagree, however, on whether those benefits outweigh the costs  I-1351 would cost nearly $5 billion through 2019 for more teachers and other school staff  fueling a highly politicized debate that becomes more intense when money is tight.In recent years, researchers have been trying to figure out why smaller class size works, how it works and who benefits most.Nailing those questions would help educators, policymakers  and the public  understand what else they need to do besides just shrinking classes to get the biggest bang for the buck.The studies, based on classroom observations and interviews, have revealed some surprising insights: The most obvious explanation for why reducing class size works  that teachers give students better, more-tailored instruction in smaller classes  probably isnt the reason why achievement goes up. Teachers for the most part dont change their practices automatically when their classes have fewer students. Students behave better and pay more attention in smaller groups, and this may account at least initially for the gains. For example, its harder for a couple of troublemakers in the back of the room to derail the class when they cant hide in a crowd. Reducing class sizes can have the potential to make a big difference for students only if teachers get the training and administrative support to take advantage of the situation by changing how they teach and how they interact with parents.Tennessee study The most persuasive class-size research in the United States comes from a large experiment in Tennessee that   found students in small classes outperformed students in larger groups, even when teachers had the help of an aide.Project STAR (Student Teacher Achievement Ratio) was conducted in Tennessee between 1985 and 1989 and involved more than 1,200 teachers and almost 12,000 students, according to Jeremy Finn, of the University at Buffalo (State University of New York), a statistician who helped set up the experiment and publish its results.While no study of such a complex subject is immune from criticism, the results from Project STAR are highly regarded because teachers and students were randomly assigned to classes of differing sizes. That kind of experimental design is considered the gold standard because it gives researchers confidence that the effects they are seeing stem from the change (smaller class sizes) and not some other factor.The Tennessee results inspired California and Wisconsin to carry out statewide class size-reduction projects in lower grades in 1996, a time when state governments were enjoying surpluses.Theres scant research on the effects, positive or negative, of reducing class sizes in the upper grades because the variables are much harder to pin down, Finn said.Wisconsin achieved similar results to Tennessee, but California did not, which showed that simply making classes smaller is not all that needs to be addressed.In 2003, Finn co-authored a paper that identified a gaping hole in the puzzle:Despite the many studies that show positive effects, research has yet to come up with a consistent, integrated explanation for the gains attributable to reduced class size, according to the paper, published in the journal Review of Educational Research.The most intuitively satisfying explanation  that teachers give students more individualized instruction in smaller classrooms  didnt pan out when researchers observed what actually happened in smaller classes. Several studies have found that while teachers may have more interactions with students, they tend to teach the same way they always have, regardless of the size of the class.Finn and his colleagues proposed a different explanation, which they believe better fit the evidence from the studies and also jibed with classroom observations: Students behave better and participate more often when they cant hide in the back of the classroom.He saw the change himself visiting classrooms in Buffalo.In a big class, everybody in the back of the room is talking and giggling, and the little kids are throwing things at each other, Finn said. But in a small class, the first thing a teacher says is Lets all bring our chairs around me here in a circle. Smaller, quieter classes (fewer than 20 students) may have their biggest effect on kids who are inattentive and try to avoid looking the teacher in the eye.    Thats because they cant hide either.Using Project STAR data, Finn compared the academic performance of fourth-graders considered to be disruptive,   inattentive or neither.Most people I talk to predict that the disruptive kids are the worst, but theyre not. The inattentive, withdrawn kids are by far and away poorer students than all the others, Finn said. If you want to get lost in the back corner, whether youre disruptive or not ... you disconnect yourself from any instruction at all.

For example, sometimes schools would put two veteran teachers in the same room, which lowered the class size on paper.But in practice, if one teacher was doing administrative work while the other was teaching all the kids, then the class size had effectively gone up for those kids.

I dont know how many classrooms I saw where they used a row of bookcases as a wall ... and anytime the other class did anything noisy, everything ground to a halt in the class next door.Smaller classes worked best when teachers received training in how to better tailor instruction to each students needs and when they spent more time getting to know their students families.Class-size reduction alone will only get fewer children in a class, Graue said. It doesnt translate directly to a change in achievement.The same year Wisconsin launched SAGE, California rolled out its own statewide class-size reduction, which wasnt as successful as SAGE or Tennessees Project STAR.Critics have pointed to Californias rapid hiring of inexperienced teachers and the lack of physical space to accommodate the smaller classes, which affected kids at low-income schools the most.And even in Wisconsin and Tennessee, there were wide variations in the effect that smaller classes had from building to building.Often it comes down to the individual school, Graue said.

Researchers generally agree that lower class sizes, at least in the earliest grades, are linked to positive educational benefits such as better test scores, fewer dropouts and higher graduation rates, especially for disadvantaged children.They disagree, however, on whether those benefits outweigh the costs  I-1351 would cost nearly $5 billion through 2019 for more teachers and other school staff  fueling a highly politicized debate that becomes more intense when money is tight.In recent years, researchers have been trying to figure out why smaller class size works, how it works and who benefits most.Nailing those questions would help educators, policymakers  and the public  understand what else they need to do besides just shrinking classes to get the biggest bang for the buck.The studies, based on classroom observations and interviews, have revealed some surprising insights: The most obvious explanation for why reducing class size works  that teachers give students better, more-tailored instruction in smaller classes  probably isnt the reason why achievement goes up. Teachers for the most part dont change their practices automatically when their classes have fewer students. Students behave better and pay more attention in smaller groups, and this may account at least initially for the gains. For example, its harder for a couple of troublemakers in the back of the room to derail the class when they cant hide in a crowd. Reducing class sizes can have the potential to make a big difference for students only if teachers get the training and administrative support to take advantage of the situation by changing how they teach and how they interact with parents.Tennessee study The most persuasive class-size research in the United States comes from a large experiment in Tennessee that   found students in small classes outperformed students in larger groups, even when teachers had the help of an aide.Project STAR (Student Teacher Achievement Ratio) was conducted in Tennessee between 1985 and 1989 and involved more than 1,200 teachers and almost 12,000 students, according to Jeremy Finn, of the University at Buffalo (State University of New York), a statistician who helped set up the experiment and publish its results.While no study of such a complex subject is immune from criticism, the results from Project STAR are highly regarded because teachers and students were randomly assigned to classes of differing sizes.

Five states today are replacing the standards. Lawmakers in at least 27 more have proposed delaying or scrapping them, and in Louisiana, Gov. Bobby Jindal, once a Common Core supporter, has sued the federal government over them, saying they are an attack on local control.Yet in Washington state, four years after committing to use the new benchmarks, the first two bills seeking to repeal them were introduced just last week, and even the supporters of one of them dont expect it to pass.I dont believe were going to get the bill through this session, said Sen. Maralyn Chase, D-Shoreline, one sponsor of the bill in her chamber. Why has there been so little noise in Washington over what has been a political quagmire elsewhere?Some lawmakers, parent groups and political experts say that may be because the state has had its hands full with other educational problems, especially the state Supreme Court mandate to significantly increase school spending. Others say that lawmakers here view higher standards as a good thing, and dont see the standards as federal intrusion into education, an argument that has derailed the Common Core elsewhere. More continuityLike most states, Washington signed onto the Common Core standards with little fanfare in 2011. The Common Core outlines what students should know in math and reading before they graduate from high school. Two national groups of schools chiefs and governors coordinated the writing of the standards hoping, in part, to encourage teachers to help students do more critical thinking and problem solving. Proponents said one benefit of the common benchmarks would be more continuity from state to state, helping ensure students who move dont miss an important skill  like long division  just because their old schools taught lessons in a different order. Schools in Washington have slowly phased in the standards since 2012. Tests to measure whether students are meeting them will be given statewide this spring, after pilot tests last year.The education issue that has gotten the most attention here is school funding.In 2012, one year after Washington adopted the Common Core, the state Supreme Court handed down its landmark school-funding decision, McCleary v. State of Washington, saying lawmakers were chronically underfunding the states public schools. Since then, the court has struggled to enforce its decision. Last year, it found the Legislature in contempt, saying lawmakers were making too little progress in increasing the amount of money they devote to public schools.Weve got bigger issues (than the Common Core), quite frankly, said state Sen. Steve Litzow, R-Mercer Island, who heads the Senates education committee. How are we going to have a solution for McCleary? How are we going to  raise the graduation rate and close the opportunity gap?Stephanie Jones, executive director of Community and Parents for Public Schools of Seattle, agreed.I think the prevailing attitude certainly right now is, Weve got to deal with our funding base, she said.And to many lawmakers from both parties, the Common Core makes sense. Once folks read the actual standards, its a bit of an emperor has no clothes moment, said Rep. Chad Magendanz, R-Issaquah, in an email. Both the far left and far right, he said, have found common ground in opposing the Common Core. That alliance has made Washington moderates in both parties wary of the anti-Common Core message, he said, and as a result, the political center here hasnt been swayed by the arguments.In this state, both political parties have voted to condemn the standards  the state Republicans last year, and the state Democrats last month.But their arguments dont appear to have resonated with most elected officials.And Washington doesnt fit the pattern of the five states that have revoked or are in the process of revoking the Common Core, said Daniel Thatcher, a senior policy specialist with the National Conference of State Legislatures. In each of them, Republicans controlled the House and Senate, he said, and four of the five have Republican governors, too.Tougher expectationsRandy Dorn, Washingtons schools chief, said Washingtonians support the Common Core because they generally agree that tougher expectations for students are needed. Many legislators have kind of taken a look at the Common Core, and (said), OK, the reason for doing this is to have higher expectations for all children, Dorn said. Thats it.Scrapping the standards and tests now, he said, would waste millions of dollars and all the time teachers have put into reorganizing their lessons to prepare students for them.Ramona Hattendorf, a former government-relations coordinator for the state PTA, said Washington was already trying to increase student expectations before the Common Core came along. She cited the push to raise the number of credits needed to graduate from high school.For years, the state had been trying to get college and career ready, Hattendorf said. (Common Core) seemed to be in line with what we were doing.Kim Mead, president of the Washington Education Association, said the union doesnt support the standards but doesnt oppose them, either.Most teachers, she said, are more concerned about the new tests, not the standards themselves.Sen. Pam Roach, R-Auburn, a co-sponsor of the anti-Common Core bill, listed a lot of reasons why she dislikes the standards: She doesnt think Washingtonians had enough chance to comment on them; school districts are buying expensive new textbooks to teach the standards; and the Common Core doesnt require schools to teach cursive writing, which Roach thinks everyone should learn.Chase, the Democrat sponsoring the bill, also cited a variety of reasons, including calling the standards a swipe at local control.Both say they have more to learn about the Common Core, and they hope their legislation will start a discussion that has been largely absent in Washington state until now.

Rainier Beach kids, many of whom entered high school performing below grade level, would never succeed on the college track, they said. The school was an incubator for star athletes, not serious scholars.But early results are crushing those predictions as soundly as a slam dunk.No marker is more stunning than Beachs 25-point increase in graduation rates since 2011. Last spring, 79 percent of seniors left with a diploma  better than the 74 percent district average.Parents, once so wary of Beachs reputation for gangs and lackluster academics that they were willing to pay for private school or drive 20 miles north for advanced classes, are beginning to reconsider. Projected enrollment next fall at Rainier Beach is higher than it has been in a decade.When I was a freshman, I would have cleaned sewers rather than come here, said Hussein Abshir, now a senior. Id heard the rumors so I came with really low expectations  I would have gone to North Seattle, or even Bainbridge Island.Instead, Abshir spent his junior year puzzling through Josef Stalins rise to power in an International Baccalaureate history class; being taught computer code by programmers from Microsoft; and envisioning himself as a student at the University of Washington Bothell, where he has been accepted for next fall.But his enthusiasm, and that of the 130 Rainier Beach students recommended for IB courses next year, bumps up against a discomfiting fact: Seattle Public Schools does not consider the program part of the districts official Advanced Learning options, and has no plans to fund IB beyond the startup grant that Rainier Beach will exhaust in 2017.In other words the International Baccalaureate, despite its encouraging results, is an extra, something that parents at other schools eventually end up paying for.When we started, there wasnt necessarily a vision at the district level for how we would sustain this, said Colin Pierce, who manages the IB program at Rainier Beach. That does raise the question of how Seattle uses advanced learning  is it just a student-sorting mechanism? Or can it be a way to address equity?Push from parentsPopular with the children of diplomats, the International Baccalaureate came to Rainier Beach largely at the insistence of South End parents desperate to make the school more attractive to families.Enrollment had dwindled to 366 students  a quarter the size of most local high schools  when Pierce began the arduous, three-year application process for IB certification. Opening those classes to all students, even those who would not pursue the full diploma, was part of his plan from the start, so every junior and senior now takes IB Language Arts.Simultaneously, Principal Dwane Chappelle hired more than a dozen new faculty, all of whom have been trained in IBs deep-inquiry approach to wrestling with intellectual questions.The new crop includes algebra teacher Adam Christopulos, who started four years ago with just a few tables in his classroom, because no one anticipated that hed ever have more than 18 students.Now the room is packed.We still have work to do, he said. But because the atmosphere has changed, it changes the attitude of my students. They think, Im at this school with a high-level program, and they act different.Despite the sense of evolution, Rainier Beach is no prep academy. Students sometimes doze in class. Textbooks are not always available. Last week, a senior backed away from attempting an IB diploma  the required research paper was just too much.Nevertheless, Tavares Tagaleoo, 17, says the overall climate is more serious, more scholarly, and he credits IB.It was really a shock, going from this laid-back place into a real academic school, he said. I was hesitant at first, kind of intimidated. But IB is the reason why I come every day. I dont honestly think Id still be in school if it wasnt for IB and how it challenged me.Nowadays, Pierce travels the country helping educators in other high-poverty communities make similar transitions, part of an effort on the part of the international organization to bring its high-rigor approach to more low-income kids. The number of them seeking an IB diploma has nearly doubled since 2010.But in Seattle, where academically tracked schools often split along racial lines, access to IB is an especially sensitive issue.We want to make sure our International Baccalaureate students reflect the demographics of the whole school, said Rita Green, a former Beach parent who now chairs the Seattle/King County NAACP Education Committee. We dont want it to be like Garfield, where you have two schools in one building  one for white and one for blacks.Little danger of that. Rainier Beach has few white students. It is paying for IB with a combination of federal and district grants that will last only two more years.Seattles other IB high schools  Ingraham and Chief Sealth  spent their district grants long ago and now depend on parent funding or building-level dollars to sustain their programs.But Rainier Beach has twice as many as low-income students as Ingraham, 30 percent more than Sealth and far less money-raising muscle than either.Im very concerned, said Nerissa Hallberg, the academic dean. Were in this defining moment. But it could all be up in the air when the money runs out.InequitiesHer worry pokes at old wounds, still raw.Rainier Beach families have long considered themselves ignored by the school district, so two months ago when parents began complaining that IB biology students had no textbooks, their concerns echoed loudly.Were students getting a watered-down version of the curriculum? Did the high-polish program exist in name only? (Answer: Science teacher Karla Nyquist requested new textbooks after the Christmas break and made Xeroxes for her students in the interim. But parents remain skeptical. And the books have yet to arrive.)IB has to mean something, agreed Paul Campbell, who directs national outreach for the program. There was a time when low-income schools adopted IB, and it was cosmetic more than anything. A community has to trust that their school is being held to rigorous standards.To ensure this, each IB school must conduct a detailed self-study every five years, noting how many students take the courses and tracking their performance. Sometimes those reports trigger a visit from central office staff. Once in a while they result in revoked certification.Pierce, meanwhile, is trying to rein in expectations among the first Beach seniors to take a full IB course load. That group started at 19 but now numbers eight as some, juggling the curriculums demands, have fallen away.(During its first year Ingraham had seven IB diploma candidates, only two of whom passed all of the tests. At Chief Sealth, five out of 14 first-year scholars earned an IB diploma.)Obviously, its a nice feather in the cap, Pierce said. But our primary measure of success right now is access to the curriculum, not the test scores.No need to sell Justin Jones, 15. He has never been on an airplane before, but will fly to Spain this summer as one of 10 Rainier Beach students discussing global technology with other college-bound kids at the IB World Conference in Barcelona.His old classmates down the street at South Shore Middle School would be stunned.Most of them wanted to stay away from Beach, Jones said. But I really wanted to seek out this higher form of education. Nobody in my familys graduated college  it just means a lot to me.Plain-spoken about his aspirations, the sophomore is typical of students newly attracted to Rainier Beach. The hallways where kids used to roughhouse are now silent during class. Parents who strained to send their boys to Catholic school find their children begging to attend the neighborhood legacy.I couldnt believe it, actually, said Sherrill Vaughan, who considers herself a staunch advocate for South Seattle yet discouraged her son from attending Beach. The old reputation was just too troubling, she said.Vaughan spoke while watching a block of gelatin soak up pink-tinted sodium hydroxide, listening as Pierce and Nyquist taught an IB science lesson to parents considering the IB route for their kids. At first a gloomy gray, the gelatin cubes turned pale pink, then bright, then Day-Glo.Intended as a visual representation of cellular surface area principles, for Vaughan the exercise was just more evidence of transformation underway.My mind has been changed, she said. Her son entered the school last fall.Rainier Beach, once considered the worst high school in Seattle, now has graduation rates that top the districts.Tangled in bureaucracy and tradition, public schools need years  often the better part of a decade  for real turnaround, so skeptics may wave off the spike in graduation rates at Rainier Beach High as a mere blip.Or ignore its ballooning enrollment.Or shrug at the dozens of students on track to leave with college credit for advanced studies.In the past two years, all of these things have happened at Seattles long-languishing South End school, and all trace back to the moment when Rainier Beach gambled on a rigorous curriculum with a fancy name and high-end pedigree: the International Baccalaureate.Outsiders have been dismissive from the start. Rainier Beach kids, many of whom entered high school performing below grade level, would never succeed on the college track, they said. The school was an incubator for star athletes, not serious scholars.But early results are crushing those predictions as soundly as a slam dunk.No marker is more stunning than Beachs 25-point increase in graduation rates since 2011. Last spring, 79 percent of seniors left with a diploma  better than the 74 percent district average.Parents, once so wary of Beachs reputation for gangs and lackluster academics that they were willing to pay for private school or drive 20 miles north for advanced classes, are beginning to reconsider. Projected enrollment next fall at Rainier Beach is higher than it has been in a decade.When I was a freshman, I would have cleaned sewers rather than come here, said Hussein Abshir, now a senior. Id heard the rumors so I came with really low expectations  I would have gone to North Seattle, or even Bainbridge Island.Instead, Abshir spent his junior year puzzling through Josef Stalins rise to power in an International Baccalaureate history class; being taught computer code by programmers from Microsoft; and envisioning himself as a student at the University of Washington Bothell, where he has been accepted for next fall.But his enthusiasm, and that of the 130 Rainier Beach students recommended for IB courses next year, bumps up against a discomfiting fact: Seattle Public Schools does not consider the program part of the districts official Advanced Learning options, and has no plans to fund IB beyond the startup grant that Rainier Beach will exhaust in 2017.In other words the International Baccalaureate, despite its encouraging results, is an extra, something that parents at other schools eventually end up paying for.When we started, there wasnt necessarily a vision at the district level for how we would sustain this, said Colin Pierce, who manages the IB program at Rainier Beach. That does raise the question of how Seattle uses advanced learning  is it just a student-sorting mechanism? Or can it be a way to address equity?Push from parentsPopular with the children of diplomats, the International Baccalaureate came to Rainier Beach largely at the insistence of South End parents desperate to make the school more attractive to families.Enrollment had dwindled to 366 students  a quarter the size of most local high schools  when Pierce began the arduous, three-year application process for IB certification. Opening those classes to all students, even those who would not pursue the full diploma, was part of his plan from the start, so every junior and senior now takes IB Language Arts.Simultaneously, Principal Dwane Chappelle hired more than a dozen new faculty, all of whom have been trained in IBs deep-inquiry approach to wrestling with intellectual questions.The new crop includes algebra teacher Adam Christopulos, who started four years ago with just a few tables in his classroom, because no one anticipated that hed ever have more than 18 students.Now the room is packed.We still have work to do, he said. But because the atmosphere has changed, it changes the attitude of my students. They think, Im at this school with a high-level program, and they act different.Despite the sense of evolution, Rainier Beach is no prep academy. Students sometimes doze in class. Textbooks are not always available. Last week, a senior backed away from attempting an IB diploma  the required research paper was just too much.Nevertheless, Tavares Tagaleoo, 17, says the overall climate is more serious, more scholarly, and he credits IB.It was really a shock, going from this laid-back place into a real academic school, he said. I was hesitant at first, kind of intimidated. But IB is the reason why I come every day. I dont honestly think Id still be in school if it wasnt for IB and how it challenged me.Nowadays, Pierce travels the country helping educators in other high-poverty communities make similar transitions, part of an effort on the part of the international organization to bring its high-rigor approach to more low-income kids. The number of them seeking an IB diploma has nearly doubled since 2010.But in Seattle, where academically tracked schools often split along racial lines, access to IB is an especially sensitive issue.We want to make sure our International Baccalaureate students reflect the demographics of the whole school, said Rita Green, a former Beach parent who now chairs the Seattle/King County NAACP Education Committee. We dont want it to be like Garfield, where you have two schools in one building  one for white and one for blacks.Little danger of that. Rainier Beach has few white students. It is paying for IB with a combination of federal and district grants that will last only two more years.Seattles other IB high schools  Ingraham and Chief Sealth  spent their district grants long ago and now depend on parent funding or building-level dollars to sustain their programs.But Rainier Beach has twice as many as low-income students as Ingraham, 30 percent more than Sealth and far less money-raising muscle than either.Im very concerned, said Nerissa Hallberg, the academic dean. Were in this defining moment. But it could all be up in the air when the money runs out.InequitiesHer worry pokes at old wounds, still raw.Rainier Beach families have long considered themselves ignored by the school district, so two months ago when parents began complaining that IB biology students had no textbooks, their concerns echoed loudly.Were students getting a watered-down version of the curriculum? Did the high-polish program exist in name only? (Answer: Science teacher Karla Nyquist requested new textbooks after the Christmas break and made Xeroxes for her students in the interim. But parents remain skeptical. And the books have yet to arrive.)IB has to mean something, agreed Paul Campbell, who directs national outreach for the program. There was a time when low-income schools adopted IB, and it was cosmetic more than anything. A community has to trust that their school is being held to rigorous standards.To ensure this, each IB school must conduct a detailed self-study every five years, noting how many students take the courses and tracking their performance. Sometimes those reports trigger a visit from central office staff. Once in a while they result in revoked certification.Pierce, meanwhile, is trying to rein in expectations among the first Beach seniors to take a full IB course load. That group started at 19 but now numbers eight as some, juggling the curriculums demands, have fallen away.(During its first year Ingraham had seven IB diploma candidates, only two of whom passed all of the tests. At Chief Sealth, five out of 14 first-year scholars earned an IB diploma.)Obviously, its a nice feather in the cap, Pierce said. But our primary measure of success right now is access to the curriculum, not the test scores.No need to sell Justin Jones, 15. He has never been on an airplane before, but will fly to Spain this summer as one of 10 Rainier Beach students discussing global technology with other college-bound kids at the IB World Conference in Barcelona.His old classmates down the street at South Shore Middle School would be stunned.Most of them wanted to stay away from Beach, Jones said. But I really wanted to seek out this higher form of education. Nobody in my familys graduated college  it just means a lot to me.Plain-spoken about his aspirations, the sophomore is typical of students newly attracted to Rainier Beach. The hallways where kids used to roughhouse are now silent during class.

testxu,xuzhaotest,"""Educator"",""abc""",Yes,Clearly,Clearly,Clearly,Clearly,Clearly,http://www.seattletimes.com/news/behind-bars-college-is-back-in-session-in-some-washington-prisons/,"Every week, they slide books through the metal detectors  novels by Virginia Woolf and Jane Austen, copies of the U.S. Constitution, texts on sociology, psychology and comparative religion.Then dozens of professors and instructors from Washingtons public and private colleges    surrender their drivers licenses and car keys to an armed guard, walk through the detector themselves, and pass through a perimeter fence topped by coils of gleaming razor wire.They have come to    teach some of the states most unlikely college students: men and women serving time for felonies such as rape, robbery and murder.Many think inmates    dont deserve the kind of higher education that law-abiding citizens must pay tens of thousands of dollars to get, a view that led lawmakers, as part of a get-tough-on-crime push in the 1990s, to bar federal and state money from supporting college classes in prison.But now, such classes are starting to creep back, operating on shoestring budgets with private money,   in the belief that they will more than pay for themselves by giving felons skills that can help them get jobs, reducing the recidivism rate. Supporters point to a    2013 study by the nonprofit RAND Corp., which concluded that prisoners who participated in education programs were 43 percent less likely to return to prison within three years of release, and also found that every dollar spent on inmate education translated to $4 to $5 saved on re-incarceration.The study couldnt unravel whether college classes made the difference, because it looked at all levels of schooling, including GEDs and vocational education. But studies being done now are tackling   that question. In the meantime, participating academics believe theyre making a difference  for the inmates and society as a whole.Teaching in prison is the most fulfilling thing Ive ever done, said Reid Helford, a sociologist with a Ph.D. from Loyola University in Chicago, who teaches sociology to inmates at the Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla.Education does more than offer inmates a credential, he added, saying it teaches them how to be the people we want our fellow citizens to be  thoughtful, critically aware of the world around them, disciplined and able to recognize authority.Visiting professorsOne morning this fall, Robin Jacobson, an assistant professor of politics and government at the University of Puget Sound (UPS), stood before 16 inmates at the Washington Corrections Center for Women near Gig Harbor, lecturing about how a bill works its way through Congress. The women, dressed in gray sweats with prison IDs clipped to their shirts, followed her closely  taking notes, frequently raising their hands to offer observations or ask questions.Does the president need Senate consent to fire a cabinet member? What is the importance of presidential signing statements?How could Jimmy Carter have won the 1976 election if popularity is an important component of political power?Great questions, Jacobson said, beaming.Her course is offered through the privately funded Freedom Education Project of Puget Sound (FEPPS). Twelve professors from UPS, the University of Washington, Seattle Pacific University, Tacoma Community College and Harvard Extension School receive a stipend of $1,200 per semester to pay for transportation to and from the prison. UPS students serve as study-hall tutors.The women inmates themselves asked for the classes.   Theyd heard from former prisoners   that vocational certificates didnt always translate into jobs, and they wanted something more meaningful.The fundamental question is, what do we expect from our justice system? asked Alyssa Knight, a student and inmate in her early 30s who expects to be released in 2025, 22 years after her conviction in the murder and attempted robbery of a suspected drug dealer.Do you expect it to rehabilitate a person? asked Knight. If you are just basically warehousing people, then you are not going to get a change.Tanya Erzen, executive director of FEPPS and an associate professor of religion at UPS, echoed a theme voiced by others who teach behind bars: Many inmates seem to value an education more fervently than the typical college student, for whom going to college was always a given.According to a FEPPS survey, 78 percent of the women in the program have been victims of domestic violence. More than 40 percent are high-school dropouts. In the past two years, 250 women have taken courses through FEPPS. Currently, 37 women are working toward a college degree.The program is so popular that it has a waiting list of about 50.Public money off-limitsBefore 1994, there were about 350 college prison programs nationwide, run by public colleges and universities.    But then Congress eliminated federal student Pell Grant aid to prisoners, the source of money that had paid for college classes behind bars. In 1995, Washington lawmakers followed suit with a ban on using tax money for  postsecondary education in prison. The same law expressly requires inmates to earn the equivalent of a high-school diploma. Inmates are also encouraged to learn vocational skills through classes taught by the states community colleges. That carries an annual price tag of about $15.5 million, or about $939 for each of the states 16,500 inmates.But academic college courses are off-limits, except for the privately funded programs that are offered in just four of the states prisons, and for the correspondence courses for inmates who can afford them.Last year, 980 inmates completed a high-school equivalency degree, and inmates also earned a total of 1,812 vocational certificates. But just 47 finished a two-year college degree. College-level courses started creeping back into Washington prisons in 2005, when a private group, University Behind Bars, began offering them at the Monroe Correctional Complex. Then in 2008, an inmate at the Walla Walla prison wrote to business magnate Warren Buffett and implored him to fund classes in the states oldest prison.The letter found its way to Warren Buffetts sister Doris, who supported prison education in New York through her charity, the Sunshine Lady Foundation. Doris Buffett agreed to pay for a small program at Walla Walla, and later extended it to Coyote Ridge Corrections Center near the Tri-Cities. University Behind Bars has also expanded, and now reaches nearly 200 inmates in two units of the Monroe Correctional Complex. Finding some controlParadoxically, for some, prison is a good place to go to college.Behind bars, distractions are minimized and the structure of prison life makes it more likely that inmates will finish their educations, said Henry Richards, a Seattle forensic psychologist in private practice. Richards is the liaison between the Buffett foundation and the Walla Walla prison. For many who ran afoul of the law, he said, going to school   was like prison itself  regimentation, boredom, the main emphasis is on control and being told youve failed. But while behind bars, he said, education becomes a way for inmates to control their futures.Helford, the Walla Walla Community College adjunct who teaches both GED and college-level classes at the state penitentiary, said many inmates in his courses undergo a transformation.When they first start his classes, theres something raw about them as students, he said. They really dont know how to be a good student  how to behave in the classroom, how to present an argument, how to talk intelligently.They come in angry, he said, knowing everything. But after a few semesters, they change from a somewhat immature kid to someone who has some poise, can speak intelligently, knows how to learn about something.Helford and Richards both acknowledge that the inmates who want college-level work may be the most academically capable men and women in the state prison system.As such, they may be least likely to ever reoffend, no matter what kind of education they get in prison.Still, two decades after funding for prison education was stripped away, there is a deep understanding that college in prison was a good thing, and that its sorely missed, said Vivian Nixon, executive director of the College & Community Fellowship, a New York-based nonprofit involved in prison education advocacy.In the past, she said, inmates enrolled in college courses often mentored prisoners working on their high-school diplomas. There was a better culture of learning  not just in education but in treatment programs for substance abuse, parenting programs, work training programs, she said.Over the years, some Washington legislators have tried to amend the law so some state money could be used for college-level classes. But strong opposition still exists. A 2013 bill, for example, would have allowed the Department of Corrections to carve money out of its budget to pay for prison education, but the bill died in committee.In New York last year, Gov. Andrew Cuomos proposal to provide basic financing for college-education programs in that states prisons also went nowhere. One lawmaker called it a slap in the face to hardworking New Yorkers struggling to send their kids to college.TransformationsInmates who   take college classes say that wrestling with big ideas stretches their intellectual muscles and relieves the monotony of prison life.To do homework in their cells, they must turn off the TV and put away the playing cards. When classes took off at the womens prison, inmates put aside their complaints about prison life and began discussing English literature, or comparative religion, or American history. It pervaded our existence in here  it started to transform what people were thinking about, said Knight, the inmate who is serving time for the murder of a drug dealer in Spokane.Richards said a similar thing happened at the Walla Walla prison, as racial conflict and antagonism  hallmarks of prison life  were pushed to the background while inmates focused on their coursework.The professors say they dont dumb down the coursework for their prison classes. For most inmates, thats meant having to step up their writing skills, and take remedial math. Marriam Oliver, an inmate at the womens prison,   has been locked up since she was 14 years old, after she and four other teens and an adult were convicted of killing an Everett man in 2001.    One of her triumphs in prison was reading Virginia Woolf, and then discussing the English novelists work with a college-going family member who came to visit.You see a lot of people coming back to prison, and a lot of that has to do with their education, said Oliver, who is scheduled to be released in 2023. And I refuse to be one of those people that didnt take advantage of opportunities. A five-year study now under way will help determine if she is right.The Pathways from Prison to Postsecondary Education Project, led by the nonprofit Vera Institute of Justice,   is studying whether a college education in prison is a good investment.Researchers hope to build on the earlier RAND study, which was unable to disentangle the effects of all the different types of education programs  basic remedial education, vocational training, and college-level courses. This demonstration project is an important opportunity to get inside the black box to really understand what program elements and dosage is associated with different outcomes, said Lois Davis, one of the RAND reports authors. But advocates  and some inmates  are already convinced.Tanya Wilson is working on her degree while serving two consecutive 10-year terms for two counts of second-degree murder  in Washington.    She   believes that inmates who complete a college education may be better equipped to break the cycle of crime in their families that leads them to prison in the first place.Who would you rather live beside, she asked, a person thats just getting out of prison who just sat in her cell and stewed, or do you want somebody who has transformed, who is educated, who will not be a drain on society?

The behavior described is completely inconsistent with the universitys values and expectations.He called such behavior unacceptable.UW officials are asking anyone with photos, recordings or videos of the incident to email them to the Student Life office at OFSL@uw.edu.Earlier this month, the SAE chapter at the University of Oklahoma was abruptly closed by the fraternitys national organization after a video surfaced of SAE members reciting racist chants on a bus. The university later expelled two students. On Thursday, the investigation spread to SAE chapters on other campuses.The UWs Black Student Union (BSU) has asked for a formal apology from SAE and plans to seek sanctions against the fraternity from the UW Interfraternity Council, the governing body of the universitys off-campus fraternities and sororities.During the Feb. 25 march, which was organized to raise awareness about racism, student Dirir Abdullahi said he heard several white men shouting racial slurs from the front yard of the SAE fraternity house while he and hundreds of others marched by.There were several students who were screaming out loud, You apes, why are you here on our campus,  said Abdullahi, 21, a senior majoring in neurobiology.Several other protesters also heard the slurs, Abdullahi and others said Wednesday, but the march continued to Gerberding Hall, where protesters delivered demands to the UW presidents office.Zane Suarez, another student who participated in the march, said he witnessed four or five men on the second-floor balcony of the fraternity who were booing and making obscene gestures.But some students who participated said that while they observed some men near the fraternity acting disrespectfully toward marchers, they arent certain they were fraternity members.In a statement, Michael Hickey, president of the UWs SAE chapter, said the offensive comments came from nonmembers who were standing on the sidewalk near the chapter house. He said he did not have any information about students yelling from the balcony.Hickey said the fraternity members were concerned and shocked by these allegations, as we pride ourselves in the diversity of our chapter membership and racism is against the moral ethics of our local and national organization.He said the fraternity is committed to working with others to help hold those accountable for their offensive behavior on February 25.The alleged incident occurred as the protest march moved onto the UW campus at 17th Avenue Northeast and Northeast 45th Street, directly across from the SAE fraternity house. By that time, the march had dwindled to about 100 people.SAE was the only fraternity that marchers walked past.Members of the BSU hope to meet with UW interim President Ana Marie Cauce on Friday about the allegations.Its unclear what kind of sanctions, if any, the university could impose on a fraternity if it were proved to have insulted students because of their race or political beliefs.Abdullahi said the young mens shouts appeared to be part of an organized counterprotest against marchers.Shortly after the protest march, Abdullahi said, he recounted the incident to march organizers and fellow BSU members. More witnesses raised allegations later that evening, during a BSU meeting to discuss the march.BSU President Maggie Negussie said Thursday the fraternity also sent a representative to the meeting, which upset BSU members.They sent one of their only black male fraternity members, she said. A lot of people saw that as disrespectful. Hes one of the only black males in their house and he actually didnt even hold a position (of rank) in the fraternity.Aside from Abdullahi, several other students also witnessed disturbing behavior from white men in front of the SAE fraternity during the protest march, Negussie said.Such behavior included young men at the house shouting slurs, flipping off protesters and jeering marchers as they came by, she said.Many of the students whove made the allegations dont want to speak out publicly about what they witnessed for fear theyll be targeted, Negussie said.During the incident he observed, Abdullahi said, several Seattle police officers who were escorting marchers intervened to tell the young men who were shouting slurs to quiet down.A Seattle police spokesman said Thursday he could find no record documenting that incident.Suarez said his first reaction was anger when he heard the men booing on the SAE balcony, and giving protesters the finger. But because the march was winding down, he put it out of his mind.After the video emerged of the SAE chapter at the University of Oklahoma chanting racist slogans, Suarez and others in the BSU began thinking about the SAE incident here and decided to take action.I know individuals who are part of this fraternity  they are nothing like this, he said.

test,test,"""Parent""",Yes,Clearly,Clearly,Clearly,Clearly,Clearly,http://www.seattletimes.com/news/behind-bars-college-is-back-in-session-in-some-washington-prisons/,"Every week, they slide books through the metal detectors  novels by Virginia Woolf and Jane Austen, copies of the U.S. Constitution, texts on sociology, psychology and comparative religion.Then dozens of professors and instructors from Washingtons public and private colleges    surrender their drivers licenses and car keys to an armed guard, walk through the detector themselves, and pass through a perimeter fence topped by coils of gleaming razor wire.They have come to    teach some of the states most unlikely college students: men and women serving time for felonies such as rape, robbery and murder.Many think inmates    dont deserve the kind of higher education that law-abiding citizens must pay tens of thousands of dollars to get, a view that led lawmakers, as part of a get-tough-on-crime push in the 1990s, to bar federal and state money from supporting college classes in prison.But now, such classes are starting to creep back, operating on shoestring budgets with private money,   in the belief that they will more than pay for themselves by giving felons skills that can help them get jobs, reducing the recidivism rate. Supporters point to a    2013 study by the nonprofit RAND Corp., which concluded that prisoners who participated in education programs were 43 percent less likely to return to prison within three years of release, and also found that every dollar spent on inmate education translated to $4 to $5 saved on re-incarceration.The study couldnt unravel whether college classes made the difference, because it looked at all levels of schooling, including GEDs and vocational education. But studies being done now are tackling   that question. In the meantime, participating academics believe theyre making a difference  for the inmates and society as a whole.Teaching in prison is the most fulfilling thing Ive ever done, said Reid Helford, a sociologist with a Ph.D. from Loyola University in Chicago, who teaches sociology to inmates at the Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla.Education does more than offer inmates a credential, he added, saying it teaches them how to be the people we want our fellow citizens to be  thoughtful, critically aware of the world around them, disciplined and able to recognize authority.Visiting professorsOne morning this fall, Robin Jacobson, an assistant professor of politics and government at the University of Puget Sound (UPS), stood before 16 inmates at the Washington Corrections Center for Women near Gig Harbor, lecturing about how a bill works its way through Congress. The women, dressed in gray sweats with prison IDs clipped to their shirts, followed her closely  taking notes, frequently raising their hands to offer observations or ask questions.Does the president need Senate consent to fire a cabinet member? What is the importance of presidential signing statements?How could Jimmy Carter have won the 1976 election if popularity is an important component of political power?Great questions, Jacobson said, beaming.Her course is offered through the privately funded Freedom Education Project of Puget Sound (FEPPS). Twelve professors from UPS, the University of Washington, Seattle Pacific University, Tacoma Community College and Harvard Extension School receive a stipend of $1,200 per semester to pay for transportation to and from the prison. UPS students serve as study-hall tutors.The women inmates themselves asked for the classes.   Theyd heard from former prisoners   that vocational certificates didnt always translate into jobs, and they wanted something more meaningful.The fundamental question is, what do we expect from our justice system? asked Alyssa Knight, a student and inmate in her early 30s who expects to be released in 2025, 22 years after her conviction in the murder and attempted robbery of a suspected drug dealer.Do you expect it to rehabilitate a person? asked Knight. If you are just basically warehousing people, then you are not going to get a change.Tanya Erzen, executive director of FEPPS and an associate professor of religion at UPS, echoed a theme voiced by others who teach behind bars: Many inmates seem to value an education more fervently than the typical college student, for whom going to college was always a given.According to a FEPPS survey, 78 percent of the women in the program have been victims of domestic violence. More than 40 percent are high-school dropouts. In the past two years, 250 women have taken courses through FEPPS. Currently, 37 women are working toward a college degree.The program is so popular that it has a waiting list of about 50.Public money off-limitsBefore 1994, there were about 350 college prison programs nationwide, run by public colleges and universities.    But then Congress eliminated federal student Pell Grant aid to prisoners, the source of money that had paid for college classes behind bars. In 1995, Washington lawmakers followed suit with a ban on using tax money for  postsecondary education in prison. The same law expressly requires inmates to earn the equivalent of a high-school diploma. Inmates are also encouraged to learn vocational skills through classes taught by the states community colleges. That carries an annual price tag of about $15.5 million, or about $939 for each of the states 16,500 inmates.But academic college courses are off-limits, except for the privately funded programs that are offered in just four of the states prisons, and for the correspondence courses for inmates who can afford them.Last year, 980 inmates completed a high-school equivalency degree, and inmates also earned a total of 1,812 vocational certificates. But just 47 finished a two-year college degree. College-level courses started creeping back into Washington prisons in 2005, when a private group, University Behind Bars, began offering them at the Monroe Correctional Complex. Then in 2008, an inmate at the Walla Walla prison wrote to business magnate Warren Buffett and implored him to fund classes in the states oldest prison.The letter found its way to Warren Buffetts sister Doris, who supported prison education in New York through her charity, the Sunshine Lady Foundation. Doris Buffett agreed to pay for a small program at Walla Walla, and later extended it to Coyote Ridge Corrections Center near the Tri-Cities. University Behind Bars has also expanded, and now reaches nearly 200 inmates in two units of the Monroe Correctional Complex. Finding some controlParadoxically, for some, prison is a good place to go to college.Behind bars, distractions are minimized and the structure of prison life makes it more likely that inmates will finish their educations, said Henry Richards, a Seattle forensic psychologist in private practice. Richards is the liaison between the Buffett foundation and the Walla Walla prison. For many who ran afoul of the law, he said, going to school   was like prison itself  regimentation, boredom, the main emphasis is on control and being told youve failed. But while behind bars, he said, education becomes a way for inmates to control their futures.Helford, the Walla Walla Community College adjunct who teaches both GED and college-level classes at the state penitentiary, said many inmates in his courses undergo a transformation.When they first start his classes, theres something raw about them as students, he said. They really dont know how to be a good student  how to behave in the classroom, how to present an argument, how to talk intelligently.They come in angry, he said, knowing everything. But after a few semesters, they change from a somewhat immature kid to someone who has some poise, can speak intelligently, knows how to learn about something.Helford and Richards both acknowledge that the inmates who want college-level work may be the most academically capable men and women in the state prison system.As such, they may be least likely to ever reoffend, no matter what kind of education they get in prison.Still, two decades after funding for prison education was stripped away, there is a deep understanding that college in prison was a good thing, and that its sorely missed, said Vivian Nixon, executive director of the College & Community Fellowship, a New York-based nonprofit involved in prison education advocacy.In the past, she said, inmates enrolled in college courses often mentored prisoners working on their high-school diplomas. There was a better culture of learning  not just in education but in treatment programs for substance abuse, parenting programs, work training programs, she said.Over the years, some Washington legislators have tried to amend the law so some state money could be used for college-level classes. But strong opposition still exists. A 2013 bill, for example, would have allowed the Department of Corrections to carve money out of its budget to pay for prison education, but the bill died in committee.In New York last year, Gov. Andrew Cuomos proposal to provide basic financing for college-education programs in that states prisons also went nowhere. One lawmaker called it a slap in the face to hardworking New Yorkers struggling to send their kids to college.TransformationsInmates who   take college classes say that wrestling with big ideas stretches their intellectual muscles and relieves the monotony of prison life.To do homework in their cells, they must turn off the TV and put away the playing cards. When classes took off at the womens prison, inmates put aside their complaints about prison life and began discussing English literature, or comparative religion, or American history. It pervaded our existence in here  it started to transform what people were thinking about, said Knight, the inmate who is serving time for the murder of a drug dealer in Spokane.Richards said a similar thing happened at the Walla Walla prison, as racial conflict and antagonism  hallmarks of prison life  were pushed to the background while inmates focused on their coursework.The professors say they dont dumb down the coursework for their prison classes. For most inmates, thats meant having to step up their writing skills, and take remedial math. Marriam Oliver, an inmate at the womens prison,   has been locked up since she was 14 years old, after she and four other teens and an adult were convicted of killing an Everett man in 2001.    One of her triumphs in prison was reading Virginia Woolf, and then discussing the English novelists work with a college-going family member who came to visit.You see a lot of people coming back to prison, and a lot of that has to do with their education, said Oliver, who is scheduled to be released in 2023. And I refuse to be one of those people that didnt take advantage of opportunities. A five-year study now under way will help determine if she is right.The Pathways from Prison to Postsecondary Education Project, led by the nonprofit Vera Institute of Justice,   is studying whether a college education in prison is a good investment.Researchers hope to build on the earlier RAND study, which was unable to disentangle the effects of all the different types of education programs  basic remedial education, vocational training, and college-level courses. This demonstration project is an important opportunity to get inside the black box to really understand what program elements and dosage is associated with different outcomes, said Lois Davis, one of the RAND reports authors. But advocates  and some inmates  are already convinced.Tanya Wilson is working on her degree while serving two consecutive 10-year terms for two counts of second-degree murder  in Washington.    She   believes that inmates who complete a college education may be better equipped to break the cycle of crime in their families that leads them to prison in the first place.Who would you rather live beside, she asked, a person thats just getting out of prison who just sat in her cell and stewed, or do you want somebody who has transformed, who is educated, who will not be a drain on society?

It says come here, said Clyde Hills principal, Mary Olin.Unlike immigrants who arrive with little formal education, these parents are typically highly educated, often bilingual, and, school officials say, have high expectations for their childrens academic achievement.For the past two years, Olin has welcomed these families with bimonthly coffees, parent cultural ambassadors who speak five different languages, and teachers newly trained to engage students who have never spoken English before.Olin, who was previously principal of the American School in Shanghai, said she sees her role as cultural guide, answering families practical questions, such as where to find a doctor but also interpreting an American education system where a positive report card may say meets standards and where parents are welcomed inside the school.I experienced this as a principal in China, if youre going to the principals office, youre perceived as a troublemaker. We try to break down some of those stereotypes, to let parents know, Were here to support you. Our doors are open. Theres no one in this building whos not accessible to you.Asian students  both foreign and American born  now make up about one-third of the districts enrollment and more than 70 percent of those in its gifted programs. Bellevue started tracking students country of origin only this year, but U.S. census data for the city of Bellevue show a sharp increase in Chinese and Asian Indian families since 2000.And district records of students first languages show the number of Mandarin, Cantonese and Taiwanese speakers has jumped 91percent over the past decade, to about 1,600, while the number who speak an Indian language has grown more than fourfold, from 185 in 2004 to more than 800 today. Thats still a small fraction of the districts total enrollment of about 19,100, but the influx of new Asian immigrants is changing the scene  and the parents questions  at many of Bellevues schools.At a recent welcome coffee, 20 new families met with Olin as well as the schools PTA co-presidents and several of the cultural ambassadors. The PTA leaders, Paleia Cartier and Radha Joshi, show the schools diversity in action. Cartier and her husband both grew up in Clyde Hill and attended the school.When I was a kid, there was not diversity at all, she said.Joshi grew up in Utah, the daughter of Indian immigrants and the only non-Caucasian in her schools. She moved to Bellevue a year ago and said she was surprised by the number of East Indians and other international families.Joshi noted that if a child from China doesnt speak English, the school will try to put him or her with a buddy who also speaks Chinese.People here embrace you. A lot of the new families are pleasantly surprised to find out they are welcomed here, she said.The two tell parents about school activities and opportunities to participate. Volunteering is often another foreign concept, they say. Some parents tell them they were dropped off at school at 8 a.m. and didnt see their parents again until 5. The notion that the school might want their help is a surprise.The PTA leaders also introduce the idea of making financial donations to support the school. Last year, they say, the $250,000 raised paid for five additional instructional assistants to help teachers in the classroom.Parents have told them that in their countries, giving money to a public official would be considered a bribe. And while these parents may pay for their own childs education and extra activities, they arent familiar with making a donation to help all students.Two Polish parents, Krystian and Magdalena Walec, say that at his previous posting in the United Kingdom, there was no welcome coffee if a student arrived at the start of the school year.The couple say theyre pleased by their experience so far at Clyde Hill.The school is very open. They let us know whats going on, Krystian said.Moms have been thereThat same morning, on the opposite side of Bellevue, another coffee was held for about a dozen Japanese moms new to the district. Leading the session were two older mothers who emigrated from Japan a generation before and experienced the cultural isolation of being some of the few international parents at their childrens schools.They explained to the new mothers some American elementary-school customs, like exchanging valentines, and answered more serious questions about math instruction (Does the American way prefer the process to the correct answers and speed of calculations?) and about bullying (Do racial bullies exist in Bellevue schools?).Yes to both, said Haruka Kojima, in Japanese, translating later for a visitor. She told the mothers that when she reported an incident of bullying to a dean of students, it was acted upon quickly. And she said the district is currently undertaking an equity initiative meant to improve cultural understanding and respect. But yes, she said, it does sometimes happen.Kojima and her friend Linda Mui started the multi-language principal coffees at Chinook Middle School, then Bellevue High School, then Clyde Hill. She now helps lead twice-monthly districtwide meetings for Japanese parents.A puzzle for some of the immigrant parents, Kojima said, are the districts three highly promoted educational goals. The parents understand academic success and college and career readiness, but not the third  positive and productive life.Kojima said Asian families are more familiar with competition for good grades and class ranking. They wonder why the schools here require community service for graduation and encourage involvement in sports and school clubs.Here, theres more interest in the whole personality  community service, leadership, volunteerism. Its a whole different concept, she said.She also worries that Asians growing numbers and their success in the school district  such as high enrollment in the gifted program  could lead to a backlash.People here may resent us, feel invaded, she said. But she also observed that the value many Asians place in education and hard work may also raise achievement throughout the district. The standards of education may be rising, she said.Sally Schroedl, a second-grade teacher at Clyde Hill, keeps an energetic class attentive with interesting math problems and the possibility that any student could be called upon next.During fall she completed an intensive district training program to help engage and support English-language learners. She encourages the students to confer in teams. The international students hear English speakers explain their answers, giving them confidence that they can do the same. Schroedl said she includes her students names in the math problems: Raika and Olivia, Jing Chen and Yian, Daeyon and Ella Detroit.Two, Jing Chen and Yian, she said, spoke no English at the beginning of the school year. Now they each take a turn standing in front of the classroom with a microphone and whiteboard.These are the kids who are usually timid. When they speak, its quietly. But over the past few months, she said, theyve really blossomed.New friendshipsAfter the morning coffee for new families, parents talk with other Chinese or Indian parents, expressing surprise that they should meet at this school, halfway around the world.Karthik Durghados said his son Thejas is making friends, and not only with other Indian children.His buddys name is Jack, Durghados said. He explained how Jack gave Thejas Seahawk tattoos to wear for the Super Bowl. His parents bought him a Russell Wilson jersey. They watched the game with neighbors at a city community center. Thejas was inconsolable after the loss.Still, his dad said, when he asked his son recently if he wanted to return to India, the boy said, Im liking it here. I dont want to go back.","[{""tag"":""problem"",""text"":"" and Yian, she said, spoke no English at the beginning of the school year.

A new system of in-depth observation by trained evaluators and principals, soon to be required in schools across Washington, shows what can help.After playing outside on a blustery December morning, the toddlers at Happy Tots Childcare in Renton plopped down for circle time.What had they noticed in the yard, their teacher, Benaz Amin, asked.Wind? she prompted. Remember? It blew all the toys around.They smiled, but said nothing, so she moved on.Watching from a corner of the room, evaluator Elaine Jackson made a mental note: Amin had missed an opportunity for the kind of conversation that builds learning.Amin might have asked the children, for example, what the wind did to the trees or whether they had ever lost power at home.Jackson is part of a growing effort to solve a tough problem: how to accurately and fairly critique teaching in ways that helps teachers improve.The art of teaching has long been considered something of a black box  a matter of personal style, intuition and philosophy that couldnt be defined, much less reliably measured.But now the lid is starting to come off.Trained observers like Jackson  armed with elaborate guides that describe what good teaching looks like and how to rate it  are changing the way teachers are evaluated, not only in preschool but in K-12 classrooms.These new, in-depth observations are replacing or supplementing the ways teachers have been judged in the past, most often with superficial visits by school principals.The goal is to make teacher evaluations more objective than a principals opinion and more useful for self-improvement than a ranking based on student test scores.The state has been rolling the new guides out slowly  both in a new quality rating system for early childhood education and in public-school districts.By the fall of this year, all K-12 principals must, under state law, judge teachers using one of three guides, which are all based on teaching practices with a track record for effectiveness.In the early education world, the state is using a fourth tool, called CLASS, which is backed by some of the deepest and highest quality research to date showing that it can improve both teaching and student achievement.Weve now done four different experimental trials for this from preschool to high school and its worked every single time to improve the quality of interactions of the classroom and improve childrens learning, said CLASS co-creator Robert Pianta, dean of the University of Virginia School of Education.Focus on interactionsMore than 20 years ago, Pianta and his colleagues set out to answer basic questions: What matters most in preschool and how can it be measured reliably?Preschools traditionally had been judged by whether their electrical outlets had safety plugs and other stuff that was easy to count, like books on the shelves and blocks in the bins. Teaching quality? Not so much.Up until that point, there were observations done all the time, but they were observations of stuff in the room, Pianta said. There were not observations of what the teachers were doing. So the CLASS really stood that on its head.Pianta, a psychology professor and former seventh-grade teacher, focused on the way that children learn from their parents  their first and most important teachers.He and his colleagues already knew from decades of research that strong parent-child bonds encourage children to venture from the safety of a warm lap to learn about their world.Those moment-to-moment interactions between parents and children lay the foundations for skills that become even more important later, such as paying attention, persistence and self-control.So they extended that idea to teacher-child interactions, categorizing them into three broad areas based on what research has shown to be key to childrens emotional, social and intellectual growth.In the emotional-growth category, they listed interactions that make children feel welcome and safe, recognize their needs and respond to their interests.In the second, they placed examples of good social instruction, in which teachers prevent or defuse misbehavior and orchestrate smooth transitions so kids arent standing around.The third  which was hardest for most teachers  focused on instructional interactions that boost intellectual growth.But evaluators do more than just count the number of open-ended questions a teacher asks or how often they connect concepts to something in a childs everyday life.You cant gauge it on the teachers behavior in isolation, Pianta said. You have to be able to watch the impact of the interaction on the child and then watch what the teacher does in response to the child.Once the CLASS researchers had their yardstick, they tested it in two large-scale studies and found that it was a good gauge of strong instruction.They found that students entering kindergarten scored higher on tests of language and cognitive ability when their teachers had scored higher on CLASS.Many other studies of CLASS  though not all  have found similar associations.The team has since developed similar tools for elementary, middle and high schools  although not soon enough to be included among Washingtons approved guides.One surprising finding: In the tens of thousands of classrooms that CLASS researchers have observed, they see the same pattern  teachers score better on supporting emotional growth and managing behavior than they do on providing instruction.CLASS researchers, in other words, have concluded that most teaching is mediocre or worse, with teachers doing most of the talking and students filling out work sheets.The good news is that those interactions can be improved.One of the strongest CLASS studies showed that middle- and high-school teachers who were randomly assigned to a yearlong, CLASS-based training program appeared to teach better the following year.The 2011 study, published in the journal Science, found that the students of the CLASS-trained teachers scored higher on math, English, science and history exams than the students of teachers who received the districts typical in-service training.The difference was about 10 percentage points.We do actually know what works and its not just your personal style, said Kellie Morrill, an administrator at Educare School of Greater Seattle, a highly rated program that has used CLASS for years.One of Educares most veteran teachers, Judy Somerville, has seen decades of Ivory Tower fads come and go, with teachers rolling their eyes and muttering this too shall pass.CLASS isnt one of those things, Somerville said. It gives us real concrete information about where to put our interest and our focus.Not a cure-allIn practice, this is how a CLASS evaluation works:Observers like Jackson are trained in how to identify strong instruction so they can rate it accurately and consistently.Then they go into classrooms, where they typically watch a teacher for one or two hours. They observe for 20 minutes at a time, then take about 10 minutes to rate the interactions theyve noted before starting a new cycle.They focus on everything teachers do and say, whether its asking kids questions about the block tower theyre building or simply giving an upset child a hug.Jackson remembers one teacher who leaned up against a window sill with her arms crossed while the children played.My score sheet was almost blank because there just werent any words, any interactions, Jackson said.At Tiny Tots in Renton, on the other hand, Jackson noted approvingly how Amin, the teacher, talked with her charges, three boys from ages 2 to 3, while they slurped Kix cereal.Amin leaned in while one boy, Liam, whispered that he saw a big tree outside the window.What else? she asked.A car, Liam whispered.A car. Oooh. What kind of car do you see outside? she asked.Thats the kind of serve-and-return exchange that typically receives high marks.Yet for all its strengths, CLASS is not a cure-all, said University of Washington professor Gail Joseph, who works closely with Piantas group and helped develop the states quality rating system for preschools and child-care centers.Sometimes observers miss something, for example, or catch teachers on a bad day.Joseph also said CLASS is not well-suited for students who are learning English as a second language. And University of Florida researchers say that CLASS doesnt measure the kind of highly structured teaching that some students with disabilities need.A large teacher-evaluation study funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation concluded that observational guides like CLASS work best when teachers are observed multiple times by multiple observers, which is costly.Dan Goldhaber, a professor at UW Bothell who specializes in evaluating teacher performance, worries that the K-12 guides Washington school districts are using wont be useful because they may not pick up differences in teaching quality.Early results from the eight pilot districts in Washington state trying out the new guides showed that no teacher was rated unsatisfactory.Unless your judgment is that all teachers are equally successful, youve got to have your measure of teacher performance show differentiation, Goldhaber said.Struggling teachers were deliberately excluded from the pilot program, which researchers say skews the results.But the initial ratings may also reflect principals inexperience using the new tools, said Stephen Fink, executive director of the UW Center for Educational Leadership, which developed one of the three systems that K-12 public schools must use.People say that teaching isnt rocket science and I would argue that its actually more complicated than rocket science, Fink said.Funding at stake?The stakes for using the tools correctly are high.The federal government uses CLASS to rate Head Start preschools and programs, and the ones that score very low risk losing their contracts.Washington state is considering restricting state subsidies for preschool and child care to programs that earn at least 3 out of 5 stars from the Early Achievers quality rating system, in which CLASS scores weigh heavily. So is the city of Seattle.Of the three other systems that public-school districts are using  mostly one developed by former teacher and economist Charlotte Danielson and the one developed by Finks group at the UW  none have been tested as widely as CLASS.But next school year, the U.S. Department of Education will put the UWs tool to the test in 100 elementary schools across the country, with principals in half the schools randomly assigned to receive coaching from the UWs Center for Educational Leadership and the other half serving as a control group.Researchers want to know if the training causes improvements in student achievement.Meanwhile, the Anacortes School District, which has worked closely with UW to test the UW evaluation system, has some anecdotal evidence that students are doing better, said Cindy Simonsen, director of learning and instruction.The biggest immediate benefit, she said, is that principals and teachers are better able to talk about teaching using the guide as a common reference.Principals always have been able to fire bad teachers, she said, but until now havent had much to say to a teacher who was satisfactory but wanted to do better.We have a lot of teachers who want to be above average, Simonsen said.And Amin at Happy Tots Childcare?She says participating in the Early Achiever program  which provides free coaching to teachers preparing for the in-person CLASS evaluation  improved her teaching.Last week, she received her rating  3 out of 5 stars, which the state considers excellent, with room to grow.","[{""tag"":""problem"",""text"":""In the early education world, the state is using a fourth tool, called CLASS, which is backed by some of the deepest and highest quality research to date showing that it can improve both teaching and student achievement.\We\ve now done four different experimental trials for this from preschool to high school and it\s worked every single time to improve the quality of interactions of the classroom and improve children\s learning,\ said CLASS co-creator Robert Pianta, dean of the University of Virginia School of Education.Focus on interactionsMore than 20 years ago, Pianta and his colleagues set out to answer basic questions: What matters most in preschool and how can it be measured reliably?Preschools traditionally had been judged by whether their electrical outlets had safety plugs and other stuff that was easy to count, like books on the shelves and blocks in the bins.
